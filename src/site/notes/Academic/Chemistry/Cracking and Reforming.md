### Cracking and Reforming in Chemistry

#### Catalytic Reforming
- **Process**: Catalytic reforming is a chemical process used to increase the octane number of a petroleum fraction.
- **Method**: It is achieved by heating the hydrocarbon feedstock to about 500 °C in the presence of a catalyst (e.g., platinum on alumina support).
- **Reactions**: The process includes various reactions, primarily isomerization, and cyclization, which result in an increased proportion of branched-chain alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatic compounds.

#### Cracking
- **Purpose**: Cracking is a process used to increase the octane number of a petroleum fraction by breaking down longer-chain hydrocarbons into shorter, more branched ones.
- **Catalytic Cracking**:
  - **Method**: The hydrocarbon molecules are passed through a bed of a zeolite catalyst at about 500 °C under pressure.
  - **Outcome**: Produces branched-chain alkanes, cycloalkanes, and aromatic compounds, enhancing the fuel's octane number.
  - **Example Reaction**: C11H24 → C8H18 + C3H6 (alkane to alkane and alkene).
- **Hydrocracking**:
  - **Variation**: Involves heating long-chain hydrocarbons with hydrogen and a catalyst under high temperature and pressure.
  - **Result**: Converts long-chain alkanes into shorter-chain alkanes, without forming alkenes due to the presence of hydrogen.
  - **Advantages**: Increases the octane number, and produces branched alkanes and cycloalkanes.
- **Thermal Cracking**:
  - **Alternative Process**: Known as thermal or steam cracking.
  - **Method**: Involves heating long-chain molecules at high temperatures (around 900 °C) and sometimes high pressure.
  - **Outcome**: Breaks down long-chain alkanes into shorter-chain alkanes and alkenes.
  - **Note**: Alkenes have a higher octane number but are less desirable in car engines due to their tendency to form gums.
