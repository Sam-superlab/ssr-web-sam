## Enriching of U-235
Enriching uranium to increase the concentration of U-235 in U-238 is a complex and technically challenging process. Natural uranium primarily consists of U-238 (about 99.3%) and a very small amount of U-235 (about 0.7%). U-235 is the isotope needed for nuclear reactors and weapons due to its ability to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. Here are the common methods used for uranium enrichment:

1. **Gaseous Diffusion**:
   - **Process**: Uranium hexafluoride (UF6), a gaseous form of uranium, is forced through semi-permeable membranes.
   - **Principle**: Because U-235 atoms are slightly lighter than U-238 atoms, they diffuse through the membrane slightly faster.
   - **Efficiency**: This method requires a significant amount of energy and multiple stages of diffusion to achieve a noticeable increase in U-235 concentration.

2. **Gas Centrifugation**:
   - **Process**: UF6 is placed in high-speed centrifuges.
   - **Principle**: The centrifugal force causes the heavier U-238 molecules to move outward more than the lighter U-235 molecules. This separation allows the extraction of UF6 enriched in U-235.
   - **Efficiency**: Gas centrifugation is more energy-efficient than gaseous diffusion and is the predominant method used today.

These processes require sophisticated equipment and control, as well as significant energy inputs. The degree of enrichment depends on the intended use of the uranium. For nuclear power reactors, enrichment levels of 3-5% U-235 are typical, whereas weapons-grade uranium is enriched to over 90% U-235. Due to the potential for misuse in nuclear weapons production, uranium enrichment is heavily regulated and monitored internationally.
