>Covalent bonding occurs when atoms <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">share</mark> electrons, and a covalent bond is the electrostatic attraction between a shared pair of electrons and the nuclei of the atoms that are bonded.

## Multiple covalent bonds
- It is possible for more than one pair of electrons to be shared between two atoms. A double bond results from the sharing of two pairs of electrons, and a triple bond arises when three pairs of electrons are shared.

## Polarity
- Electronegativity
	- Electronegativity is a measure of the attraction of an atom in a molecule for the electron pair in the covalent bond of which it is a part.

*Atoms with similar electronegativities will form covalent bonds. Atoms with widely different electronegativities will form ionic bonds. The difference in electronegativity can be taken as a guide to how ionic or how covalent the bond between two atoms is likely to be.*
