## The octet rule
>Atoms in covalent bonds have a tendency to have a full valence shell with a total of eight electrons (or two in the case of hydrogen). This is known as the octet rule.

## Coordinate covalent bonds (dative covalent bonds)
*This concepts also related to the ligands in [[Academic/Chemistry/Topics/The periodic table\|The periodic table]].*
>A coordinate covalent bond is a type of covalent bond in which both electrons come from the same atom.

## Lewis (electron dot) structures
### Resonance structures
>These individual structures differ only in the position of the double bond and are called resonance structures.

| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Add up the total number of valence electrons of all the atoms in the molecule/ion.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 2    | Divide by two to get the total number of valence electron pairs.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 3    | Each pair of electrons is represented by a line.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 4    | Arrange the lines (electron pairs) so that all the atoms are joined together by at least single bonds and the outer atoms have full outer shells, i.e. are connected to four lines.                                                           |
| 5    | Rearrange the lines (electron pairs) so that every period 2 atom has four pairs of electrons. The outer atoms already have four pairs, so this should normally involve moving only lone pairs so that they become bonding pairs of electrons. |
|      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

## VSEPR theory
>Pairs of electrons (electron domains) in the valence (outer) shell of an atom repel each other and will therefore take up positions in space to minimise these repulsions – to be as far apart in space as possible.

*The order of repulsion strength is:
lone pair–lone pair > lone pair–bonding pair > bonding pair–bonding pair*

## Polar molecules
The electronegativity difference between two atoms covalently bonded together results in the electrons lying more towards one atom than the other. We call such a bond polar.

>**Although individual bonds may be polar, a molecule may be nonpolar overall if, because of the symmetry of the molecule, the dipole moments of the individual bonds cancel out.**
