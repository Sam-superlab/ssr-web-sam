## Voltaic Cell
In Voltaic cell, it contains:
- 2 kind of metal and metal ion solution($\ce{M_{(s)},M_{(aq)}}$)
- salt bridge
- external circuit

## SHE(Standard Hydrogen electrode)
>The SHE is a hydrogen half-cell comprising a solution of ﻿﻿$1 mol dm^{–3}$ H+ ions at 298 K, hydrogen gas at 100 kPa and 298 K and a platinum electrode. It is linked to a second half-cell through an external circuit.


## **Electroplating**
>Electroplating involves the electrolytic coating of an object with a thin metallic layer![Attachments/Pasted image 20230905094306.png](/img/user/Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230905094306.png)


## **Products of Electrolysis**
- To deduce the products of electrolysis:
1. Write down what chemicals you have in your set up. Normally inert electrodes are used, so the chemicals in question are the cations and anions of the molten salt itself
2. Determine towards which electrode the different ions will flow. The cations are attracted to the negative electrode and will migrate towards it. Likewise, the anions will migrate to the positive electrode (the anode)
3. At the surface of the negative cathode, the positive ions are reduced as they gain electrons from it. Likewise, at the positive anode the anions are oxidized as they lose electrons to the positive surface
4. If it is not directly obvious, use section 24 of the ﻿﻿IB data booklet to find the most powerful half reactions that can take place. 
5. Combine the two half reactions and check that the complete reaction is balanced. Note that there must be an equal number of electrons in both half equations.
