## Introduction
>**Intermolecular forces** are forces between molecules.
*Intermolecular forces are much weaker than covalent bonds.*

- Intermolecular force(Van der Waals’ forces)
	- London (dispersion) forces
		- The main type between non-polar atoms/molecules
	- dipole−dipole interactions
	- dipole−induced dipole interactions

## London Dispersion force
>**London forces are temporary (instantaneous) dipole–induced dipole interactions.**

***In general, London forces get stronger as the relative molecular mass increases.***

## The effect of polar molecules
**Permanent dipole–permanent dipole interactions**, or usually just **dipole–dipole** attractions.

**If molecules with similar relative molecular masses are compared, polar molecules have higher melting and boiling points than non-polar molecules.**

## Hydrogen bonding
Hydrogen bonding is much strong than London force and normal dipole-dipole force.

The requirements for hydrogen bonding are that the $\ce{H}$ atom is attached to a very electronegative atom $\ce{N}$, $\ce{O}$ or $\ce{F}$ which possesses at least one lone pair of electrons.

- Examples
	- $\ce{NH3}$

	- $\ce{HF}$

	- $\ce{H2O}$

*It is important to realise that, although hydrogen bonding is the strongest of the intermolecular forces, it is much weaker than covalent bonding.*

## Melting points and boiling points
>Only intermolecular forces are broken when covalent molecular substances are melted or boiled – covalent bonds are not broken.

>London Force $<$ permanent dipole dipole $<$ Hydrogen bonding
>**Weakest**--------------------------------> **Strongest** 

*Relative molecular mass generally substances with higher relative molecular masses have higher melting points and boiling points due to stronger London forces.*

## Solubility
>Generally a substance will dissolve in a solvent if the intermolecular forces in the solute and solvent are similar.

*Solubility is discussed here from the point of view of energy, but entropy changes (discussed in [[Academic/Chemistry/Topics/Energetics/Energetics & Thermochemistry\|Energetics & Thermochemistry]]) must also will be considered.*

**Substances that are able to participate in hydrogen bonding will generally be soluble in water**, because they are able to hydrogen bond to the water.

*Longer chain alcohols become progressively less soluble in water*
