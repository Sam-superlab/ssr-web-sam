## Introduction
>Metallic bonding is the electrostatic attraction between the positive ions in the lattice and the delocalised electrons.

- Property
	- Metals are malleable/ductile because of the non-directionality of the bonding.![Attachments/Screenshot 2023-08-08 at 10.43.36 AM.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202023-08-08%20at%2010.43.36%20AM.png)

## Alloys
>Alloys are homogeneous mixtures of two or more metals, or of a metal with a non-metal.

**Alloys tend to be stronger and stiffer than pure metals and often combine the desirable properties of the different metals involved.**
