# Key Definitions in Abstract Algebra

## Group Theory

### Basic Concepts

**Group**: An ordered pair $(G, \cdot)$ where $G$ is a non-empty set and $\cdot$ is a binary operation satisfying:
- Closure: $a \cdot b \in G$ for all $a, b \in G$
- Associativity: $(a \cdot b) \cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$
- Identity: There exists $e \in G$ such that $e \cdot a = a \cdot e = a$
- Inverses: For each $a \in G$, there exists $a^{-1} \in G$ such that $a \cdot a^{-1} = a^{-1} \cdot a = e$

**Abelian Group**: A group where the operation is commutative: $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$ for all $a, b \in G$

**Order of a Group**: The number of elements in a finite group, denoted $|G|$

**Order of an Element**: The smallest positive integer $n$ such that $g^n = e$, denoted $|g|$

### Subgroups

**Subgroup**: A non-empty subset $H$ of a group $G$ that forms a group under the same operation, denoted $H \leq G$

**Normal Subgroup**: A subgroup $N$ of $G$ such that $gNg^{-1} = N$ for all $g \in G$, denoted $N \trianglelefteq G$

**Quotient Group**: The group $G/N$ of cosets of a normal subgroup $N$ in $G$

### Homomorphisms

**Group Homomorphism**: A map $\phi: G \to H$ such that $\phi(g_1 g_2) = \phi(g_1) \phi(g_2)$

**Isomorphism**: A bijective homomorphism, denoted $G \cong H$

**Kernel**: $\ker(\phi) = \{g \in G \mid \phi(g) = e_H\}$

**Image**: $\text{Im}(\phi) = \{\phi(g) \mid g \in G\}$

- For all $r \in R$ and $x \in I$, both $rx$ and $xr$ are in $I$

**Principal Ideal**: An ideal generated by a single element, denoted $(a)$

**Prime Ideal**: A proper ideal $P$ such that if $ab \in P$, then either $a \in P$ or $b \in P$

**Maximal Ideal**: A proper ideal $M$ such that there is no ideal $I$ with $M \subset I \subset R$
