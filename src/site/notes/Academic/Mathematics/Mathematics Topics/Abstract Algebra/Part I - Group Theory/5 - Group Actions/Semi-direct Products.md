# Semi-direct Products

## Introduction

The direct product combines two groups in a way that elements from one group commute with elements from the other. The semi-direct product is a more general and intricate construction that allows for a non-trivial interaction between the groups, "twisting" them together. This structure appears far more frequently in nature than the direct product.

## Outer Semi-direct Product

**Definition 5.1 (Outer Semi-direct Product)**: Let $N$ and $H$ be groups, and let $\phi: H \to \text{Aut}(N)$ be a homomorphism from $H$ to the automorphism group of $N$. The **outer semi-direct product** $N \rtimes_\phi H$ is the set of ordered pairs $(n, h)$ with $n \in N$, $h \in H$, equipped with the operation:

$$(n_1, h_1) \cdot (n_2, h_2) = (n_1 \phi(h_1)(n_2), h_1 h_2)$$

Here, the homomorphism $\phi$ dictates how elements of $H$ act on (or "twist") the elements of $N$ during multiplication. If $\phi$ is the trivial homomorphism (mapping every element of $H$ to the identity automorphism), this construction reduces to the direct product.

## Inner Semi-direct Product

**Definition 5.2 (Inner Semi-direct Product)**: A group $G$ is the **inner semi-direct product** of a normal subgroup $N$ by a subgroup $H$ (denoted $G = N \rtimes H$) if:

1. $G = NH$
2. $N \cap H = \{e\}$

Note that unlike the internal direct product, only one of the subgroups ($N$) is required to be normal.

## Examples

### Example 1: Dihedral Groups

The dihedral group $D_n$ is a semi-direct product of its cyclic subgroup of rotations $C_n = \langle r \rangle$ and a subgroup of order 2 generated by a reflection, $\langle s \rangle$. Here, $D_n \cong C_n \rtimes_\phi C_2$, where the non-identity element of $C_2$ acts on $C_n$ by sending an element to its inverse.

### Example 2: Symmetric Groups

The symmetric group $S_n$ is the semi-direct product of the alternating group $A_n$ and any subgroup of order 2 generated by a single transposition: $S_n \cong A_n \rtimes C_2$.

### Example 3: Affine Group

The **affine group** $\text{Aff}(n, \mathbb{R})$ consists of all affine transformations of $\mathbb{R}^n$. It is a semi-direct product:

$$\text{Aff}(n, \mathbb{R}) \cong \mathbb{R}^n \rtimes \text{GL}(n, \mathbb{R})$$

where $\mathbb{R}^n$ represents translations and $\text{GL}(n, \mathbb{R})$ represents linear transformations.

### Example 4: Holomorph

The **holomorph** of a group $G$ is the semi-direct product $G \rtimes \text{Aut}(G)$, where $\text{Aut}(G)$ acts on $G$ by automorphisms.

## Properties

### Order
The order of a semi-direct product is $|N \rtimes_\phi H| = |N| \cdot |H|$.

### Normal Subgroup
$N$ is always a normal subgroup of $N \rtimes_\phi H$.

### Commutativity
Elements from $N$ and $H$ do not necessarily commute, unlike in direct products.

### Associativity
Semi-direct products are associative: $(N \rtimes_\phi H) \rtimes_\psi K \cong N \rtimes_{\phi \circ \psi} (H \rtimes_\psi K)$.

## Applications

### Application 1: Understanding Group Structure

Semi-direct products help us understand the structure of many important groups, such as dihedral groups, symmetric groups, and affine groups.

### Application 2: Group Classification

Semi-direct products are essential for classifying groups of small order and understanding their structure.

### Application 3: Representation Theory

Semi-direct products are important in representation theory, where they correspond to induced representations.

### Application 4: Galois Theory

Semi-direct products appear naturally in Galois theory, particularly in the study of field extensions.

## Comparison with Direct Products

### Direct Product
- Both subgroups are normal
- Elements from different factors commute
- Simpler structure

### Semi-direct Product
- Only one subgroup is normal
- Elements from different factors may not commute
- More complex but more general structure
