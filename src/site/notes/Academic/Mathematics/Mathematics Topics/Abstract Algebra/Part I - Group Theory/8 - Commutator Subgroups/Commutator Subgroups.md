# Commutator Subgroups

## Introduction

The commutator subgroup measures how far a group is from being abelian. It is a fundamental concept that leads to the definitions of solvable and nilpotent groups—classes of groups that are "less complex" than simple groups and can be constructed from abelian groups.

## Definition of Commutator

**Definition 8.1**: For two elements $g, h$ in a group $G$, their **commutator** is the element $[g, h] = g^{-1}h^{-1}gh$. The commutator is equal to the identity if and only if $g$ and $h$ commute.

## Commutator Subgroup

**Definition 8.2**: The **commutator subgroup** (or **derived subgroup**) of $G$, denoted $G'$ or $[G, G]$, is the subgroup generated by all commutators in $G$:

$$G' = \langle [g, h] \mid g, h \in G \rangle$$

## Properties

### Normal Subgroup
The commutator subgroup $G'$ is always a normal subgroup of $G$.

### Abelianization
The key property of $G'$ is that the quotient group $G/G'$ is the "largest" abelian quotient of $G$. More precisely, a quotient group $G/N$ is abelian if and only if $N$ contains the commutator subgroup $G'$. The group $G/G'$ is called the **abelianization** of $G$.

### Characterization
The commutator subgroup is the smallest normal subgroup $N$ of $G$ such that $G/N$ is abelian.

## Derived Series

This process can be iterated to form the **derived series** of a group:

$$G^{(0)} = G, \quad G^{(1)} = [G, G], \quad G^{(2)} = [G^{(1)}, G^{(1)}], \quad \ldots, \quad G^{(n+1)} = [G^{(n)}, G^{(n)}]$$

This gives a descending chain of normal subgroups: $G \trianglerighteq G^{(1)} \trianglerighteq G^{(2)} \trianglerighteq \cdots$.

## Examples

### Example 1: Abelian Groups

For an abelian group $G$, we have $G' = \{e\}$, since all commutators are trivial.

### Example 2: Dihedral Groups

In the dihedral group $D_4$:
- $D_4' = \langle r^2 \rangle$ (the subgroup generated by the rotation by 180°)
- $D_4'' = \{e\}$

### Example 3: Symmetric Groups

- $S_3' = A_3$
- $S_4' = A_4$
- $S_5' = A_5$

### Example 4: Quaternion Group

In the quaternion group $Q_8$:
- $Q_8' = \langle -1 \rangle$

## Applications

### Application 1: Solvable Groups

The commutator subgroup is fundamental to the definition of solvable groups, which are groups whose derived series terminates in the trivial subgroup.

### Application 2: Group Classification

The commutator subgroup helps classify groups by measuring their "non-abelianness."

### Application 3: Galois Theory

The commutator subgroup is important in Galois theory, particularly in understanding solvable groups and their connection to polynomial equations.

## Perfect Groups

A group $G$ is **perfect** if $G = G'$ (i.e., $G$ equals its own commutator subgroup). Perfect groups are important because they cannot be "abelianized" further. Examples include:
- The alternating groups $A_n$ for $n \geq 5$
- The special linear groups $\text{SL}(n, \mathbb{F})$ for $n \geq 2$ and most fields $\mathbb{F}$
