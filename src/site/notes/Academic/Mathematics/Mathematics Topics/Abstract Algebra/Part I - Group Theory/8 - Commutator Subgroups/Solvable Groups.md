# Solvable Groups

## Introduction

The concept of a solvable group originated in Galois's work on the solvability of polynomial equations by radicals. Solvable groups are those that can be built from abelian groups through a series of extensions.

## Definition

**Definition 8.3**: A group $G$ is **solvable** if its derived series terminates in the trivial subgroup, i.e., $G^{(n)} = \{e\}$ for some integer $n$. An equivalent definition is that $G$ has a subnormal series with abelian factors.

## Properties

The class of solvable groups is closed under taking subgroups, quotients, and extensions. That is, if $N \trianglelefteq G$, then $G$ is solvable if and only if both $N$ and $G/N$ are solvable.

## Examples

### Example 1: Abelian Groups

All abelian groups are solvable (their derived series terminates at the first step).

### Example 2: Finite p-Groups

All finite $p$-groups are solvable.

### Example 3: Symmetric Groups

The symmetric group $S_n$ is solvable for $n \leq 4$, but not for $n \geq 5$.

The symmetric group $S_5$ is not solvable because its derived series is $S_5 \trianglerighteq A_5 \trianglerighteq A_5 \trianglerighteq \ldots$, which never reaches the trivial group since $A_5$ is simple and non-abelian (and thus a perfect group, with $[A_5, A_5] = A_5$).

### Example 4: Dihedral Groups

The dihedral group $D_n$ is solvable for all $n$. For example, in $D_4$:
- $D_4' = \langle r^2 \rangle$ (the subgroup generated by the rotation by 180°)
- $D_4'' = \{e\}$

So the derived series is $D_4 \trianglerighteq \langle r^2 \rangle \trianglerighteq \{e\}$, showing that $D_4$ is solvable.

## Connection to Galois Theory

The connection to Galois theory is profound: a polynomial equation is solvable by radicals if and only if its Galois group is a solvable group.

This is why there is no general formula for solving quintic equations by radicals—the Galois group of a general quintic is $S_5$, which is not solvable.

## Applications

### Application 1: Galois Theory

The concept of solvable groups is fundamental to Galois theory. A polynomial equation is solvable by radicals if and only if its Galois group is solvable.

### Application 2: Group Classification

Solvable groups are important in the classification of finite groups. Many important families of groups are solvable.

### Application 3: Structure Analysis

Understanding solvable groups helps us understand the structure of more complex groups.

## Metabelian Groups

A group $G$ is **metabelian** if $G'' = \{e\}$ (i.e., the second derived subgroup is trivial). Metabelian groups are solvable groups that are "close" to being abelian. Examples include:
- All abelian groups
- The dihedral groups $D_n$
- The symmetric groups $S_n$ for $n \leq 4$
