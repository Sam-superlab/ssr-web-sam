# Euclidean Domains

## Introduction

Euclidean Domains (EDs) are integral domains that have a division algorithm, making them particularly well-behaved and easy to work with. They are the most restrictive class in the hierarchy of domains.

## Definition

**Definition 10.4**: An integral domain $R$ is a **Euclidean Domain (ED)** if there exists a function $N: R \setminus \{0\} \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ (called a Euclidean norm) such that for any $a, b \in R$ with $b \neq 0$, there exist $q, r \in R$ where $a = qb + r$ and either $r = 0$ or $N(r) < N(b)$.

The existence of a division algorithm in Euclidean domains makes their structure particularly transparent.

## Properties

### Division Algorithm
The key property of Euclidean domains is the existence of a division algorithm, which allows for efficient computation of greatest common divisors using the Euclidean algorithm.

### Principal Ideal Domains
Every Euclidean domain is a Principal Ideal Domain (PID), meaning every ideal is generated by a single element.

### Unique Factorization
Since every ED is a PID, and every PID is a UFD, Euclidean domains have unique factorization.

### Greatest Common Divisors
The Euclidean algorithm can be used to compute greatest common divisors efficiently in Euclidean domains.

## Examples

### Example 1: The Ring of Integers

The integers $\mathbb{Z}$ form a Euclidean domain with the absolute value as the Euclidean norm: $N(a) = |a|$.

### Example 2: Polynomial Rings over Fields

For any field $F$, the polynomial ring $F[x]$ is a Euclidean domain with the degree function as the Euclidean norm: $N(f) = \deg(f)$.

### Example 3: Gaussian Integers

The ring of Gaussian integers $\mathbb{Z}[i] = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is a Euclidean domain with the norm $N(a + bi) = a^2 + b^2$.

### Example 4: Eisenstein Integers

The ring $\mathbb{Z}[\omega]$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ is a Euclidean domain.

## Euclidean Algorithm

The Euclidean algorithm can be used to find the greatest common divisor of two elements in a Euclidean domain:

1. Given $a, b \in R$ with $b \neq 0$
2. Apply the division algorithm: $a = q_1 b + r_1$ where $N(r_1) < N(b)$
3. If $r_1 = 0$, then $\gcd(a, b) = b$
4. Otherwise, repeat with $b$ and $r_1$
5. Continue until a remainder of 0 is obtained

## Relationship to Other Domains

Euclidean domains form the most restrictive class in the hierarchy:

$$\text{Euclidean Domains} \implies \text{Principal Ideal Domains} \implies \text{Unique Factorization Domains}$$

The implication is strict: there are PIDs that are not Euclidean domains, such as $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1 + \sqrt{-19}}{2}]$.

## Applications

### Application 1: Number Theory

Euclidean domains provide efficient algorithms for computing greatest common divisors and solving Diophantine equations.

### Application 2: Polynomial Theory

The division algorithm in polynomial rings is fundamental for polynomial factorization and root finding.

### Application 3: Linear Algebra

Euclidean domains are important in linear algebra for understanding the structure of matrices over these rings.

### Application 4: Cryptography

The Euclidean algorithm is fundamental in many cryptographic protocols.

## Extended Euclidean Algorithm

The extended Euclidean algorithm not only finds the greatest common divisor but also expresses it as a linear combination of the input elements. This is crucial for solving linear Diophantine equations and finding multiplicative inverses.
