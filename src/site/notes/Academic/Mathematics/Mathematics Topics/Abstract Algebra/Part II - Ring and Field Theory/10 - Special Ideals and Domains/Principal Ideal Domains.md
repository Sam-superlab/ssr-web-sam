# Principal Ideal Domains

## Introduction

Principal Ideal Domains (PIDs) are integral domains where every ideal is principal, meaning it can be generated by a single element. This property makes PIDs particularly well-behaved and important in algebra.

## Definition

**Definition 10.3**: An integral domain $R$ is a **Principal Ideal Domain (PID)** if every ideal in $R$ is a principal ideal, meaning it can be generated by a single element. That is, for every ideal $I$, there exists an $a \in R$ such that $I = (a) = \{ra \mid r \in R\}$.

## Properties

### Ideal Structure
In a PID, every ideal is principal, which means the ideal structure is particularly simple and well-understood.

### Divisibility
In a PID, the divisibility relation $a \mid b$ corresponds to the containment relation $(b) \subseteq (a)$.

### Greatest Common Divisors
In a PID, any two elements have a greatest common divisor, and it can be written as a linear combination of the two elements.

### Unique Factorization
Every PID is a Unique Factorization Domain (UFD), meaning every non-zero, non-unit element can be written uniquely as a product of irreducible elements.

## Examples

### Example 1: The Ring of Integers

The ring $\mathbb{Z}$ is a PID. Every ideal in $\mathbb{Z}$ is of the form $(n)$ for some integer $n$.

### Example 2: Polynomial Rings over Fields

For any field $F$, the polynomial ring $F[x]$ is a PID. Every ideal in $F[x]$ is of the form $(f(x))$ for some polynomial $f(x)$.

### Example 3: Gaussian Integers

The ring of Gaussian integers $\mathbb{Z}[i] = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ is a PID.

### Example 4: A PID that is not Euclidean

The ring $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1 + \sqrt{-19}}{2}]$ is a PID but not a Euclidean domain. This shows that the converse of the implication "Euclidean Domain $\implies$ PID" is false.

## Relationship to Other Domains

The relationship between the classes of domains is a beautiful hierarchy:

$$\text{Euclidean Domains} \implies \text{Principal Ideal Domains} \implies \text{Unique Factorization Domains}$$

Each implication is strict, meaning there are examples of PIDs that are not EDs, and UFDs that are not PIDs. For example, $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is a UFD but not a PID, as the ideal $(2, x)$ is not principal.

## Applications

### Application 1: Number Theory

PIDs are important in algebraic number theory for understanding the structure of rings of integers in number fields.

### Application 2: Linear Algebra

The structure theorem for finitely generated modules over PIDs is fundamental in linear algebra.

### Application 3: Polynomial Theory

PIDs provide a natural setting for studying polynomial factorization and divisibility.

### Application 4: Algebraic Geometry

PIDs are important in algebraic geometry for understanding coordinate rings of curves.

## Advanced Properties

### Noetherian Property
Every PID is Noetherian, meaning every ascending chain of ideals stabilizes.

### Dedekind Domains
While PIDs are important, many rings of integers in number fields are not PIDs but are Dedekind domains, which have a more general unique factorization property for ideals.
