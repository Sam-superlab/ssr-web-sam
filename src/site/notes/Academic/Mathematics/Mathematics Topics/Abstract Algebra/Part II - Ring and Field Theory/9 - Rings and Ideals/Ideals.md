# Ideals

## Introduction

In group theory, normal subgroups are the special subgroups that allow for the construction of quotient groups. In ring theory, the analogous concept is that of an ideal. Ideals play a fundamental role in ring theory and provide the foundation for constructing quotient rings.

## Definition

**Definition 9.1**: A subset $I$ of a ring $R$ is a **two-sided ideal** if it satisfies:

1. $(I, +)$ is a subgroup of $(R, +)$
2. For every $r \in R$ and every $x \in I$, both $rx$ and $xr$ are in $I$

This second condition is called the **absorption property**. For commutative rings, left and right ideals are the same.

## Properties

### Kernel of Homomorphisms
Just as normal subgroups are the kernels of group homomorphisms, two-sided ideals are precisely the kernels of ring homomorphisms. This property allows for the construction of quotient rings.

### Generated Ideals
If $S$ is a subset of a ring $R$, the **ideal generated by $S$**, denoted $(S)$, is the smallest ideal containing $S$. It consists of all finite linear combinations of elements of $S$ with coefficients in $R$.

### Principal Ideals
An ideal $I$ is **principal** if it is generated by a single element, i.e., $I = (a)$ for some $a \in R$.

## Examples

### Example 1: Ideals in $\mathbb{Z}$

The ideals in $\mathbb{Z}$ are precisely the sets $n\mathbb{Z} = \{nk \mid k \in \mathbb{Z}\}$ for some $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. These are all principal ideals.

### Example 2: Ideals in Polynomial Rings

In $\mathbb{R}[x]$, the ideal $(x^2 + 1)$ consists of all polynomials that are multiples of $x^2 + 1$.

### Example 3: Zero Ideal and Unit Ideal

- The **zero ideal** $(0) = \{0\}$ is always an ideal
- The **unit ideal** $(1) = R$ is the entire ring

### Example 4: Maximal Ideals

A **maximal ideal** is a proper ideal that is not contained in any other proper ideal. In $\mathbb{Z}$, the maximal ideals are $(p)$ where $p$ is prime.

## Types of Ideals

### Prime Ideals

An ideal $P$ is **prime** if for any $a, b \in R$, whenever $ab \in P$, then either $a \in P$ or $b \in P$.

**Examples**:
- In $\mathbb{Z}$, the prime ideals are $(0)$ and $(p)$ where $p$ is prime
- In $\mathbb{R}[x]$, the ideal $(x^2 + 1)$ is prime

### Maximal Ideals

An ideal $M$ is **maximal** if there is no other ideal $I$ such that $M \subset I \subset R$.

**Examples**:
- In $\mathbb{Z}$, the maximal ideals are $(p)$ where $p$ is prime
- In $\mathbb{R}[x]$, the ideal $(x - a)$ is maximal for any $a \in \mathbb{R}$

### Radical Ideals

The **radical** of an ideal $I$, denoted $\sqrt{I}$, is the set of all elements $r \in R$ such that $r^n \in I$ for some positive integer $n$.

An ideal $I$ is **radical** if $I = \sqrt{I}$.

## Operations on Ideals

### Sum of Ideals

The **sum** of two ideals $I$ and $J$ is the ideal $I + J = \{i + j \mid i \in I, j \in J\}$.

### Product of Ideals

The **product** of two ideals $I$ and $J$ is the ideal $IJ$ generated by all products $ij$ where $i \in I$ and $j \in J$.

### Intersection of Ideals

The **intersection** of two ideals $I$ and $J$ is the ideal $I \cap J$.

## Applications

### Application 1: Quotient Rings

Ideals are essential for constructing quotient rings, which are fundamental in algebra.

### Application 2: Algebraic Geometry

Ideals correspond to geometric objects, establishing a deep connection between algebra and geometry.

### Application 3: Number Theory

Ideals in rings of integers are crucial for algebraic number theory.
