### Tangent Planes to Level Surfaces

A **level surface** is defined by an equation of the form $F(x, y, z) = k$, where $k$ is a constant. The surface represents all points $(x, y, z)$ where the function $F$ takes the value $k$.

#### 1. **Gradient and Tangent Planes**:
The **gradient vector** $\nabla F = \langle F_x, F_y, F_z \rangle$ at a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ on the surface $F(x, y, z) = k$ is crucial because it points in the direction of the greatest rate of change of $F$. Moreover, the gradient vector is **perpendicular** (or normal) to the level surface at that point.

#### 2. **Equation of the Tangent Plane**:
At a point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ on the level surface $F(x, y, z) = k$, the **tangent plane** to the surface can be found using the gradient vector. Since the gradient $\nabla F(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is normal to the surface, the equation of the tangent plane is:
$$
F_x(x_0, y_0, z_0)(x - x_0) + F_y(x_0, y_0, z_0)(y - y_0) + F_z(x_0, y_0, z_0)(z - z_0) = 0
$$

This equation ensures that any point $(x, y, z)$ lying on the tangent plane satisfies the condition of being perpendicular to the gradient vector at $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$.

#### 3. **Example**:
Suppose we have a level surface given by $F(x, y, z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 9 = 0$, which represents a sphere of radius 3. The gradient vector $\nabla F = \langle 2x, 2y, 2z \rangle$ is normal to the surface at any point.

To find the tangent plane at the point $(2, 1, 2)$, calculate the gradient at that point:
$$
\nabla F(2, 1, 2) = \langle 4, 2, 4 \rangle
$$

Thus, the equation of the tangent plane at $(2, 1, 2)$ is:
$$
4(x - 2) + 2(y - 1) + 4(z - 2) = 0
$$
or
$$
4x + 2y + 4z = 18
$$

### Summary
- The **gradient vector** of $F(x, y, z)$ at a point on a level surface $F(x, y, z) = k$ is normal to the surface and defines the **tangent plane** at that point.
- The equation of the tangent plane is derived using the components of the gradient vector, resulting in a plane perpendicular to the gradient at that point.
