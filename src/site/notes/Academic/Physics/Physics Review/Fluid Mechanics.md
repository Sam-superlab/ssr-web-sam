## Fluid Pressure

>[! note] Pascal's Law
>The pressure produced by the external force on the fluid is the same throughout the fluid
>$$P_{1}=\frac{F_{1}}{A_{1}}=P_{2}=\frac{F_{2}}{A_{2}}\to \frac{F_{1}}{F_{2}}=\frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}$$


>[! note] Hydraulic Press
>It can convert a small force to a large force, and the distance of work increase

>[! note] Hydrostatic Equilibrium
>If the pressure of the atmosphere $P_{A}$ is included this Becomes:
>$$P_{total}=atm+ pgh$$

>[! note]  U-tube Manometer
>If one side is at pressure $P$
>$$P-P_{A}=p gh_{2}-pgh_{1}$$

>[! note] Buoyancy & Archimedes' Principle
>$$F=pgA(h_{2}-h_{1})$$

>[! ] **Ideal Fluids**
>An ideal fluid is incompressible and has zero viscosity

A Flowline is a line to represents the movement of local fluid


>[! note] Continuity equation
>A fluid of density $p$ flows through a pipe of area A at velocity v along a length L the mass flowing per unit time:$$\frac{pAL}{\Delta t}$$

That is $$A_{1}v_{1}=A_{2}v_{2}$$
This means that, the larger the area, the lower the speed

## Bernoulli equation

We can deduce the Bernoulli equation based on$$W_{1}-W_{2}=W_{r}=\Delta E$$
That is $$P_{1}+ \frac{1}{2} \rho v_{1}^{2}+ \rho gh_{2} = P_{2}+ \frac{1}{2} \rho v_{2}^{2}+ \rho gh_{2}$$
>[! note] Torricelli's Theorem
>For a large container with a small hole, we will assume $v_1=0$ 
>$$v_{2}=\sqrt{2gh}$$

***Notice that this is the same as the velocity of an object dropped from a height $h$***
