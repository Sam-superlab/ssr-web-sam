## Torque
The torque can be described in
$$\tau=F\times r_{(Force Arm)}= Fr\sin \theta$$

$$E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$$(Translation Energy)

$$E_{k}=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^{2}$$
(Rotation)

>[!note] 
>Rotation the $I$ is equal to mass in Translation motion

## Adiabatic Processes


## Heat Pumps and refrigerators

The principle is to use the **compressor** to vapor 




# The second Law of Thermodynamics

>[! note]  2nd Law of Thermodynamics
>- It is impossible to transfer energy from a body at a lower T to one at a higher T without doing work on the system.
>- It is impossible to extract energy from a hot reservoir and transfer this entirely into work



>What is ordered energy?
>- Potential energy
>What is unordered energy
>- Kinetic energy
