**1. Concept Origin:**
   - **Proposed by:** Louis de Broglie in 1924.
   - **Basic Idea:** Matter (like electrons) exhibits both particle and wave properties.

**2. De Broglie Hypothesis:**
   - **Wave-Particle Duality:** Particles of matter have wave-like characteristics.
   - **De Broglie Wavelength ($\lambda$):** Defines the wavelength associated with a particle.
   - **Formula:** $\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$
     - Where $h$ is Planck's constant (approximately $6.626 \times 10^{-34}$ m$^2$ kg/s).
     - $p$ is the momentum of the particle (momentum = mass $\times$ velocity).

**3. Significance in Quantum Mechanics:**
   - **Foundation for Quantum Theory:** Blurred the distinction between waves and particles, integral to the development of quantum mechanics.
   - **Dual Nature of Matter:** All particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties under different circumstances.

**4. Practical Applications:**
   - **Electron Microscopy:** Utilizes the wave nature of electrons for higher resolution imaging compared to traditional light microscopy.
   - **Determining Atomic Structures:** The wave properties of electrons are used in techniques like electron diffraction to study the arrangement of atoms in a crystal lattice.
   - **Nuclear Diameter Measurement:**
     - **Process:** High-energy electrons scattered by a nucleus create diffraction patterns.
     - **Calculation:** Using the relationship $\sin \theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{D}$ (where $D$ is the diameter of the nucleus and $\theta$ is the diffraction angle), the diameter of a nucleus can be calculated.

**5. Limitations:**
   - **Macroscopic Objects:** The wave nature is not observable in day-to-day life for larger, macroscopic objects due to extremely short wavelengths.

**6. Historical Impact:**
   - **Nobel Prize in Physics (1929):** De Broglie was awarded the Nobel Prize for his discovery of the wave nature of electrons.
   - **Influence on Other Theories:** Influenced the formulation of the Schr√∂dinger equation, a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics.
