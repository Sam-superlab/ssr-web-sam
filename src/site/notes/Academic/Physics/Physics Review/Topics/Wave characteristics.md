**WaveFront** 
>A wavefront is a surface that travels with a wave and is perpendicular to the direction in which the wave travels – the ray.

*The distance between two consecutive wavefronts is one wavelength ($\lambda$)*

$\angle i=\angle r$

**The wavelength of the wave in the denser medium is shorter than in the less dense medium** – but **the frequency remains unchanged** (although it is not possible to tell this from the the pattern shown in the ripple tank).

## Single Slit

## The intensity of waves
The energy is prop to the square of [[Academic/Physics/Physics Review/Concepts/amplitude\|amplitude]]:
$$E\propto x_0^2$$
The [[Academic/Physics/Physics Review/Concepts/intensity\|intensity]] of a wave is:
$$I= \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}=\frac{P}{A_{\text{surface}}}$$
*This equation shows that intensity has an inverse-square relationship with distance from the point source*

**The principle of superposition**

## Polarization
>Polarization of a transverse wave restricts the direction of oscillation to a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation.![Attachments/Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 10.39.05 AM.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202023-08-07%20at%2010.39.05%20AM.png)

*Hence, longitudinal wave does not exhibit polarization *

- Type of polarization
	- Plane polarized
		- When the direction of vibration stays constant over time
	- Partial polarization
		- when there is some restriction to direction of vibration but not $100\%$.

This is an example of polarization of a beam
- 
	- Figure 10 shows how we represent polarized and unpolarized light diagramatically

	- Figure 11 shows some examples of this.

## Polarization of light
Polaroid
>polarizing filter:

*The first of the two Polaroids is called the polarizer and the second is called the analyser.* 

**Malus’s law**
>When totally plane-polarized light (from a polarizer) is incident on an analyser, the intensity $I$ of the light transmitted by the analyser is directly proportional to the square of the cosine of angle between the transmission axes of the analyser and the polarizer.

- The proof of Malu's law
	- We already know that [[Academic/Physics/Physics Review/Concepts/intensity\|intensity]] is prop to the square of amplitude(we denote the electric vector as $\vec{\textbf{E}_0}$). That is $I_{0}\propto \vec{\textbf{E}_0^2}$ ![Attachments/Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 10.57.08 AM.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202023-08-07%20at%2010.57.08%20AM.png) By this graph we can write: $I_{0}\propto \vec{\textbf{E}_0^2}cos^2(\theta)$ Taking the ratio we have:$$\frac{I}{I_{0}}=\frac{\vec{\textbf{E}_0^2}cos^2(\theta)}{\vec{\textbf{E}_{0}^2}}$$Which gives:
$$I=I_0cos^2\theta$$ ![Attachments/Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 11.01.45 AM.png](/img/user/Attachments/Screenshot%202023-08-07%20at%2011.01.45%20AM.png)
- The Intensity in diff angle
	- $\theta=0^{\circ},180^{\circ}$    The intensity is maximum, the transmission axes of the two Polaroids are parallel.
	- $\theta=90^{\circ}$ The intensity is minimum, no light is transmitted by the analyser when the Polaroids are crossed.
