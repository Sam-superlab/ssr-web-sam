**Prospect theory** (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) describes the way people choose between alternatives that involve risk, where the probabilities of outcomes are known. The theory states that people evaluate these losses and gains using heuristics.  One of those heuristics is the **framing effect**, in which people react to choices depending on how they are presented or "framed." People prefer certain outcomes when information is framed in positive language, but prefer less certain outcomes when the same information is framed in negative language.
