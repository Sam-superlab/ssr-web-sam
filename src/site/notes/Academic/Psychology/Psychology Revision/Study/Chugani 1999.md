## Aim
Using pet scans to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">investigate glucose metabolism in newborn babies</mark> to see when brain areas reach the adult level of functioning

## Procedure
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Quasi Experiment</mark>: no manipulation, babies already have their brains. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Newborns between 0 and 1 month were given PET Scan.</mark> PET, or positron emission tomography, scans show how tissues and organs function.

## Results
Demonstrated that glucose metabolism in newborn babies was most prominent in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">primary sensory and motor cortex, thalamus, and brainstem</mark>. Other regions were not active.

## Conclusion
Newborns have a limited amount of active areas of the brain. The areas active are important for basic survival whereas non-essential functions have not been explored yet.

## Limitations
- No cause/effect  
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Presumably small sample size  </mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Expensive  </mark>
- Low ecological validity  
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Ethics (of study):  
- Putting a newborn through a PET Scan  
- Radiation exposure</mark>
