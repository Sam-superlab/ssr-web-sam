## Aim
to investigate the variables that may predict acculturative stress in a nationally representative sample of Asian immigrant and Asian Americans

## Participants
the sample consisted of **2095 Asian Americans**  
**1271 were first-generation immigrants** who were 18 years or older when they came to the US  
the rest of the sample was born in the US to first-generation immigrant parents  
the sample consisted of several different Asian cultures (Chinese, Filipino, Vietnamese)

## Procedure
the researchers carried out **semi-structured interviews** conducted either face-to-face or over the Internet by interviewers of a similar cultural/linguistic background of participants  
**a random sample of participants was contacted to validate the data taken from the interviews**  
the interviews measured the participants' **level of acculturative stress, the impact of language proficiency, language preference, discrimination, social networks, family cohesion, and socioeconomic status** on this stress

## Result
of the 2095 participants, **1433 were found to have acculturative stress (70%)**

## Conclusion
 **bilingual language preference contributes to lower acculturative stress** because social networks can be constructed with family and friends --> wider support system  
**the preference for speaking only English is a predictor of high acculturative stress**  
**negative treatment** (xenophobia, prejudice, harassment, threats) **contributes to higher acculturative stress**  
sharing similar values and beliefs as a family significantly contributes to lower acculturative stress

## Evaluation 
strengths:  
- provides detailed (rich qualitative) information  
- provides insight for further research  
- permitting investigation of otherwise impractical (or unethical) situations  
- high ecological validity  
  
limitations:  
- inability to generalize results to the wider population  
- researcher bias  
- difficult to replicate (but other studies, like that of Clive Wearing, display the same results confirm the findings)  
- time-consuming ?
