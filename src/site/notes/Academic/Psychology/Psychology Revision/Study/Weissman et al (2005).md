### Study Note: Weissman et al. (2005) - Depression and Genetic Link

#### Aim
The study aimed to investigate the potential genetic nature of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) across three generations within families.

#### Procedure
- **Design**: Longitudinal kinship study.
- **Sample**: 161 grandchildren, their parents, and grandparents.
- **Duration**: 20-year period.
- **Selection**: Grandparents with depression were selected from an outpatient clinic specializing in mood disorders; non-depressed participants were from the same local community.
- **Assessment**: Parents and children were interviewed four times over the study period. The third generation (grandchildren) was also included.
- **Evaluation Method**: Clinicians, unaware of past depression diagnoses, conducted evaluations. Children were assessed by a child psychiatrist and a psychologist.

#### Results
- **High Rates of Psychiatric Disorders**: 59.2% of grandchildren with two generations of major depression showed signs of psychiatric disorders by age 12, predominantly anxiety disorders.
- **Increased Risk with Depressed Grandparents and Parents**: The risk of disorders was higher in children if both grandparents and parents had depression.
- **Parental Depression Severity Correlation**: The severity of a parent's depression correlated with a higher rate of mood disorders in children.
- **Parental Depression Without Grandparental History**: No significant effect on grandchildren if only the parent, but not the grandparent, had a history of depression.

#### Conclusion
The study suggests a strong genetic component in the transmission of Major Depressive Disorder, as evidenced by the increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders in grandchildren when both the previous generations had depression.

#### Critical Thinking
- **Strengths**:
  - Longitudinal design provides robust data over time.
  - Multi-generational approach offers comprehensive insights.
  - Use of clinicians blind to past diagnoses reduces bias.
- **Limitations**:
  - The sample may not be representative of the general population.
  - The study focuses on one specific disorder, limiting the generalizability to other psychiatric conditions.
  - Potential environmental factors influencing depression were not deeply explored.

#### Relation to Gene and Behavior
This study demonstrates a clear relationship between genetic factors and behavior, particularly in the context of depression. The increased prevalence of psychiatric disorders in grandchildren with a family history of depression across two generations strongly indicates a genetic link in the transmission of depressive behaviors and susceptibilities. This finding underscores the importance of considering genetic factors in understanding and treating psychiatric disorders like Major Depressive Disorder.
