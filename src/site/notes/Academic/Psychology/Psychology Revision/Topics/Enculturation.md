## Definition
A significant part of the development of our identity is the learning and maintenance of the behaviors and norms of our own culture.  This is a process called **enculturation**. learn the necessary and appropriate skills and norms in the context of their culture. 

## Theory 
**Social Cognitive Theory** – or observational learning – plays a key part in this development. Finally, what psychologists call **participatory learning** is also important. In this type of learning, children engage in an activity and then transfer that learning to later situations.

## Issue
There are too many variables that may play a role that is not possible to limit the explanation simply to the modeling of behavior.  For example, since the majority of caregivers are still women, boys, and girls have a very similar experience in their development.

## Evaluations
Evaluation of social cognitive theories of enculturation

A strength of the social cognitive theory is that it takes into account the social and cultural context in which enculturation occurs. It predicts that children acquire internal standards for behavior through reward and punishment - either by personal or vicarious experience. A number of empirical studies support the notion of modeling.

One weakness of the social cognitive theory is that it cannot explain why there seems to be considerable variation in the degree to which children conform to a culture's norms - for example, the level to which individual boys and girls conform to gender role stereotypes. The Social Cognitive Theory does not explain the nonconformists.

Another limitation is that when discussing enculturation, there are too many variables that may play a role that is not possible to limit the explanation simply to the modeling of behavior.  For example, since the majority of caregivers are still women, boys, and girls have a very similar experience in their development. SLT does not account for this. Based on SCT's argument, children's gender identity should overall be more feminine. This shows the importance of peers and other socializing factors.
