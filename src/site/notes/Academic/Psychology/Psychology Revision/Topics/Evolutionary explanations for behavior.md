**Evolutionary psychology** is grounded in the theory that as genes mutate, those that are advantageous are passed down through a process of natural selection.

##  **Social Competition Hypothesis**
Price (1994) sees depressive behavior as part of an “involuntary subordinate strategy” that provides “a mechanism for yielding in competitive situations”. Depressive behaviors in humans are likened to the submissive behaviors shown by other species to reduce aggression, signal defeat, and prevent physical injury during conflict. Price suggests that we have evolved a mechanism that triggers a cascade of symptoms including reduced interest, motivation, and initiative when faced with a ‘no win’ situation. These changes lead to submissive behaviors including social withdrawal which allows ‘losers’ to adjust to their reduced social status. While these behaviors may have prompted our primitive ancestors to conserve energy and minimize injury, today they are viewed as maladaptive and often hinder our ability to cope in the face of difficulties. Changes in social position are as common now as they were in our evolutionary past and depression as a result of loss, be it through personal bankruptcy, marital breakdown, or bereavement, is a widespread phenomenon.
