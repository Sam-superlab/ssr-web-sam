>[! note] Definition
Localization of function is the theory that specific parts of the brain are responsible for specific behaviors or cognitive processes. 

**Basic Concept**: Localization of brain function means that specific locations in the brain are linked to distinct functions or behaviors. For example:

- The hippocampus is involved in memory processes.
- The prefrontal cortex is associated with decision-making, planning, and impulse control.
- The amygdala plays a role in emotion and emotional responses.
