**Functional MRI (fMRI)**: This is a special type of MRI that measures and maps the brain's activity. fMRI works by detecting changes in blood oxygenation and flow that occur in response to neural activity â€“ when a brain area is more active, it consumes more oxygen, and to meet this increased demand, blood flow increases to the active area.
