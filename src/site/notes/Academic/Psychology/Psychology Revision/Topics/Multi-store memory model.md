#con 
The **Atkinson–Shiffrin model** (also known as the **multi-store model** or **modal model**) is a model of memory proposed in 1968 by Richard Atkinson and Richard Shiffrin. The model asserts that human memory has three separate components:

1.  a **Sensory Memory**, where sensory information enters memory,
2.  a **Short term memory(STM)**, also called _working memory_, which receives and holds input from both the sensory register and the long-term storage, and
3.  a **Long term memory(LTM)**, where information that has been rehearsed (explained below) in the short-term store is held indefinitely.

## Issue of the model
- The model is<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> over-simplified</mark>. It assumes that each of the stores works as an independent unit.
- The model <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">does not explain memory distortion</mark>.
- The model does not explain why some things may be learned with a minimal amount of rehearsal. For example, once bitten by a dog, that memory is quite vivid in spite of the lack of rehearsal.
- There are several times that we rehearse a lot to remember information and it is not transferred to LTM.
