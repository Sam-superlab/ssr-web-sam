## Concepts
A pheromone is a chemical substance produced and released into the environment by an animal affecting the behavior or physiology of others of its species. (Often in sweat)

Two potential human pheromones are **Androstadienone** (AND) – found in male semen and sweat – and **Estratetraenol** (EST), which is found in female urine.
## Issues
It is not clear that this is also true in humans. People without a sense of smell know how to attract
