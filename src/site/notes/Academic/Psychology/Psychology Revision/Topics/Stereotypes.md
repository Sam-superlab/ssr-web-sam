## Definition
A **stereotype** is defined as a social perception of an individual in terms of group membership or physical attributes.

## Extra Information
**Stereotyping is a form of social categorization** that affects the behavior of those who hold the stereotype, and those who are labeled by a stereotype. Researchers explain stereotyping as a result of schema processing.

**Stereotype threat** occurs when one is in a situation where there is a threat of being judged or treated stereotypically or a fear of doing something that would inadvertently confirm that stereotype.
