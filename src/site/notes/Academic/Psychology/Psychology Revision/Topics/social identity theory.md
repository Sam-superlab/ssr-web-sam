## Definition
**Social Identity Theory** (By Tajfel) argues that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a person has not just one “personal self”, but rather several social selves that correspond to group membership.</mark> 

>[! note]  
>**Social Categorization**: This refers to the process of classifying people, including oneself, into different groups. This helps individuals define their place in society and understand the behavior of others.
**Social Identification**: This involves adopting the identity of the group we have categorized ourselves as belonging to. If someone strongly identifies with a group, they are likely to adopt the norms, behaviors, and attitudes of that group.
**Social Comparison**: This is the process of comparing our groups with other groups, seeing a favorable bias toward the group to which we belong. This comparison is crucial for building a sense of self-esteem.                                                                    
**Positive Distinctiveness**: Members of a group seek to achieve a positive self-concept, leading them to seek positive distinctiveness for their group in comparison to others. This can result in prejudice and discrimination against those perceived to be in the out-group.

## Issue
To what extent, our behavior is led by the social self, and to what extent is led by the personal self?
