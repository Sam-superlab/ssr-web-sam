## Calculation rules for P(A|B)
When we want the probability for Event B in the condition of Event A, we write P(A|B) Where $$P(A|B)= \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}
$$
This rule applys when A and B are associated(not independent)

## Independence
There are two ways to check if two events are independent to each other or not:
- Multiplication rule $P(A\ and\ B)=P(A)P(B)$
- Conditional probability $P(A|B)=P(A)$

>Remark: One should always be aware that independent of two events **does not** equvilent to disjoint
