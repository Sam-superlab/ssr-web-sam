>**Order statistics** are numerical summaries based on the **ordered ranking** of a [[Academic/Statistics/Quantitative Variable\|quantitative variable]] (smallest to largest)

1. ***They make no assumptions about how the data is distributed***
2. ***Are generally [[Academic/Statistics/robust\|robust]] to (unaffected by) major fluctuations in the data (i.e., outliers)***
3. ***Easier to interpret***

### How to describe center and spread in order statistics
1. [[Academic/Statistics/median\|median]] ---> related to [[Academic/Statistics/mean\|mean]] in [[Academic/Statistics/moment statistics\|moment statistics]]
2. [[Academic/Statistics/IQR\|IQR]] ---> related to [[Academic/Statistics/standard deviation\|standard deviation]] in [[Academic/Statistics/moment statistics\|moment statistics]]
