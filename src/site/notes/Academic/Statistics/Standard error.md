### Standard Error for Mean
$$SE_{\bar{x}} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$
where:
- $s$ is the sample standard deviation
- $n$ is the sample size

### Standard Error for Proportion
$$SE_{\hat{p}} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}$$
where:
- $\hat{p}$ is the sample proportion
- $n$ is the sample size

### Standard Error for Difference in Means
$$SE_{\bar{x}_1-\bar{x}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$$
where:
- $s_1$, $s_2$ are the sample standard deviations
- $n_1$, $n_2$ are the sample sizes

### Standard Error for Difference in Proportions
$$SE_{\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)}{n_1} + \frac{\hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)}{n_2}}$$
where:
- $\hat{p}_1$, $\hat{p}_2$ are the sample proportions
- $n_1$, $n_2$ are the sample sizes
