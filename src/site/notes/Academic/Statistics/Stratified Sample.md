- **definiton**
  The population is divided into subgroups (strata) based on shared characteristics (e.g., age, gender). A random sample is then drawn from each stratum.  
  - Example: Separating a school population into grades and sampling each grade.  

- **Key Features:**  
  - Strata are homogeneous within but heterogeneous between.  
  - Can be proportionate (sample size per stratum matches population proportion) or disproportionate (oversampling small strata).  

- **Advantages:**  
  - Ensures representation of all subgroups.  
  - Increases precision (lower sampling error).  
  - Allows targeted analysis of strata.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Requires prior knowledge of population structure.  
  - More complex to design and execute.  

### Key Differences  Vs. SRS

| Feature                | SRS                                  | Stratified Sampling                  |  
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| Subgroups          | Ignores subgroups                   | Explicitly defines strata            |  
| Precision          | Lower for heterogeneous populations | Higher due to reduced variability    |  
| Implementation     | Simpler                             | More complex                         |  
| Use Case           | Homogeneous populations             | Populations with distinct subgroups  |  
### When to Use  
- SRS: Best for small, homogeneous populations or when no prior subgroup information exists.  
- Stratified: Ideal for populations with distinct subgroups needing precise representation (e.g., clinical trials, demographic surveys).
