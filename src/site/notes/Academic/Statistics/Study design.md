**Key concepts**:
- [[Academic/Statistics/Randomization\|Randomization]]
- [[Academic/Statistics/treatment\|treatment]]
- [[Academic/Statistics/explanatory variable\|explanatory variable]]
- [[Academic/Statistics/sample\|sample]]
## Types of Studies
- **[[Academic/Statistics/Experiments\|Experiments]]** are studies that involve **manipulating a [[Academic/Statistics/treatment\|treatment]]** that each participant receives
	- typically treatments are *randomly assigned*(see [[Academic/Statistics/Randomization\|Randomization]]) to participants
	- we then measure participants’ response to the treatment
	- The treatment is the [[Academic/Statistics/explanatory variable\|explanatory variable]]
	- establish a ***[[Academic/Statistics/cause-and-effect relationship\|cause-and-effect relationship]]*** 
	- We need to control everything(**[[Academic/Statistics/confounding\|confounding]]**) that could change the response, except for the treatments (*[[Academic/Statistics/Randomization\|randomization]] of treatments is the best way to accomplish this*)
- **[[Academic/Statistics/Observational Studies\|Observational Studies]]** are studies that **do not** involve manipulating the explanatory variables for participants.
	- we are simply ”observing” what is going on without intervening
	- nearly all surveys are observational studies


## [[Academic/Statistics/sample\|Sample]]
We want our sample to be **representative** of our population
- this means that our sample is nearly the same as our population, only smaller
- a representative sample allows us to **generalize our results** from the sample to the pop.
- **biased**: a sample that is **not** representative

### Random Sample
We can choose people at random from our population to reduce the chances of getting a biased sample. Usually it is the best way to get a representative sample
