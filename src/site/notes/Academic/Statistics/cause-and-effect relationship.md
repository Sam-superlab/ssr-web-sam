>A **cause-and-effect relationship** in statistics refers to a situation where a change in one variable (the explanatory variable) directly produces a change in another variable (the response variable). Establishing such a relationship requires evidence that the [[Academic/Statistics/explanatory variable\|explanatory variable]] is responsible for the observed effect, ruling out other potential explanations.

### Key Insights from the Knowledge Base:
1. Experiments vs. Observational Studies (Study Design Notes):
   - Experiments with random assignment of treatments allow researchers to make causal claims. For example, in a drug trial, randomly assigning participants to treatment and control groups ensures that differences in outcomes are likely due to the drug itself, not other factors.
   - Observational studies (e.g., surveys, retrospective analyses) can only identify associations, not causation. For instance, observing that higher ice cream sales correlate with more drownings does not mean ice cream causes drownings; both are likely influenced by a third variable (e.g., hot weather).

2. Confounding Variables (Study Design Notes):
   - A confounding variable is an unmeasured factor that affects both the explanatory and response variables, creating a false impression of causation. Proper experimental design (e.g., randomization, control groups) minimizes confounding.

3. Random Assignment (Study Design Notes):
   - Randomly assigning treatments ensures that groups are comparable at the start of the experiment, isolating the effect of the treatment. This is critical for causal inference.

### Example:
If a study finds that students who attend tutoring sessions (explanatory variable) achieve higher grades (response variable), a cause-and-effect relationship can only be claimed if the study was an experiment where students were randomly assigned to attend tutoring. If it was an observational study, other factors (e.g., student motivation, prior knowledge) might explain the association.
