## what is standard deviation
>**Standard Deviation**($s$) – a way of **measuring the typical deviation (distance)** of each observation from the [[Academic/Statistics/mean\|mean]]

Mathematically:
$$s=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum\limits(x_{i}-\bar x)^2}$$
**Why do we take the square root?** Taking the square root ensures that the standard deviation has the same **units** as the original variable

**Why do we use n-1 and not n?** It’s complicated. Using n-1 gives us better estimates and predictions

## Properties
- measures spread (variability) from the [[Academic/Statistics/mean\|mean]]
	- values close to the mean = smaller contribution to s
	- values far away from the mean = larger contribution to s
- Cannot be negative
- has the same units as the original variable
