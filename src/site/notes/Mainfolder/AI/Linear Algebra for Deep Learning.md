# Linear Algebra for Deep Learning

Linear algebra provides the foundational mathematical framework for deep learning, offering the structures and operations needed to represent and manipulate data and model parameters.

## Key Concepts

### Vectors
- Fundamental units for representing data points, features, or parameters
- Can be viewed geometrically (direction and magnitude) or algebraically (ordered arrays)
- Common operations:
  - Vector addition/subtraction
  - Scalar multiplication
  - Dot product
  - Norms (L1, L2) for measuring magnitude

### Matrices
- Two-dimensional arrays used for:
  - Representing datasets (samples × features)
  - Linear transformations
  - Neural network weights
- Key operations:
  - Transpose (A^T)
  - Addition/Subtraction
  - Matrix multiplication (AB)
  - Identity matrix (I)
  - Matrix inverse (A^(-1))

### Tensors
- Generalization of vectors (1D) and matrices (2D) to higher dimensions
- Essential for:
  - Batched training data
  - Convolutional neural network operations
  - Multi-dimensional data (images, video)

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors
- For a square matrix A, eigenvector v satisfies: Av = λv
- λ is the corresponding eigenvalue
- Applications:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - Understanding linear transformations
  - Network analysis

### Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
- Fundamental matrix factorization: A = UΣV^T
- Properties:
  - U: left singular vectors (orthogonal)
  - Σ: diagonal matrix of singular values
  - V: right singular vectors (orthogonal)
- Applications:
  - Dimensionality reduction
  - Data compression
  - Feature extraction
  - [[Principal Component Analysis\|Principal Component Analysis]]

## Applications in Deep Learning

### Neural Network Operations
- Forward propagation uses matrix multiplication
- Weight matrices connect layers
- Batch processing leverages matrix operations
- See [[Mainfolder/AI/Neural Network Fundamentals\|Neural Network Fundamentals]] for details

### Computational Efficiency
- Matrix operations optimized for GPUs
- Enables parallel processing
- Critical for training large networks

### Dimensionality Reduction
- PCA for preprocessing
- Autoencoders (see [[Mainfolder/AI/Generative Models\|Generative Models]])
- Feature selection and extraction
