>Hybridisation is the mixing of atomic orbitals in a particular atom to produce a new set of orbitals (the same number as originally) that have characteristics of the original orbitals and are better arranged in space for covalent bonding.

| Hybridization | electron domain | structure       |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| $\ce{sp}$     | 2               | linear          |
| $\ce{sp^2}$   | 3               | trigonal planar |
|         $\ce{sp^3}$      |     4            |        tetrahedral         |

**The hybridisation scheme adopted in a molecule depends on the shape of the molecule.**
