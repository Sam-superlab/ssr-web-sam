## Ionic Bond
>An ionic bond is an electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions.

For ionic crystals(For example $\ce{NaCl}$) These electrostatic forces are strong, so it is difficult to break apart the lattice structure. This is a giant structure â€“ there are no individual molecules of sodium chloride. Instead, the bonding extends fairly uniformly throughout the whole structure.

## Physical properties of ionic compounds
- High melting point
	- The high melting and boiling points of ionic solids are due to the strong electrostatic forces between the oppositely charged ions. When an ionic solid is melted, the electrostatic forces throughout the giant lattice must be broken and, because these are so strong, a lot of energy is required.
- Low volatility
	- Ionic solids have low volatility (refers to how readily a substance evaporates). The volatility of ionic substances is low because the electrostatic forces between the ions are strong.
- Does not conduct electricity in solid but in liquid
	- Ionic substances do not conduct electricity when solid. In the solid state, the ions are held tightly in position in the lattice structure so that they are not free to move around (other than vibrate).When an ionic substance is melted the ions are able to move freely throughout the liquid. Positive ions can move towards a negative electrode and negative ions towards a positive electrode, so allowing the conduction of electricity.
- Ionic substances are often soluble in water
	- Ionic substances are often soluble in water. Water is a polar solvent, and energy is released when the ions are hydrated by being surrounded (iondipole attractions) by water molecules (Figure 4.6). This energy pays back the energy required to break apart the ionic lattice.
- Ionic solids are not usually soluble in non-polar solvents such as hexane.
	- Ionic solids are not usually soluble in non-polar solvents such as hexane. This is because a great deal of energy is required to break apart the ionic lattice and this is not paid back by the energy released when the nonpolar solvent forms interactions with the ions (London forces). This will be considered in more detail on page 157.
