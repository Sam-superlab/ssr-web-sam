## Formal charge and alternative Lewis structures

>‘Formal charge’ is the charge that an atom in a molecule would have if we assume that the electrons in a covalent bond are equally shared between the atoms that are bonded

FC = (# of valence electrons in the uncombined atom) – $\frac{1}{2}$(# of bonding electrons) − (# of non-bonding electrons)

$$FC=e_{valence}- \frac{1}{2} (e_{bond})-(e_{n-bond})$$
**In general, the preferred Lewis structure is the one in which the formal charges are closest to zero.**

## Exceptions to the octet rule
*In previous chapter [[Mainfolder/IBDP-Chemistry/Topics/Covalent structures\|Covalent structures]] we have talk about octet rule.*
Some central atom would have more than 8 electron in its outer orbit it is called -- expanded its octet

>For an atom to be able to expand its octet, it must be in period 3 or beyond (periods 4, 5 …).

>In a trigonal bipyramid, the axial and equatorial positions are not equivalent. Lone pairs always go in an equatorial position. This applies only to trigonal bipyramidal structures.

The summary table


## $\sigma$ and $\pi$  bonds
### $\sigma$ bond
>Atomic orbitals overlap **head-on**, the bond formed is a normal single bond and is called a sigma ($sigma$) bond
>![Screenshot 2023-08-08 at 1.31.59 PM.png](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Screenshot%202023-08-08%20at%201.31.59%20PM.png)
>*Sigma bonds result from the axial (head-on) overlap of atomic orbitals. The electron distribution in a sigma bond lies mostly along the axis joining the two nuclei.*

Here is an example of overlap for p-orbital

### $\pi$ bond
>A pi ($\pi$) bond is formed when two parallel p orbitals overlap side-on.
>![Screenshot 2023-08-08 at 1.34.33 PM.png](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Screenshot%202023-08-08%20at%201.34.33%20PM.png)
>*A π bond is formed by the sideways overlap of parallel p orbitals. The electron density in the π bond lies above and below the internuclear axis.*

- Diff type of bond
	- Single bond contains only $\sigma$ bond
	- Double bond contains one $\pi$ bond and one $\sigma$ bond
	- Triple bond contains 2 $\pi$ bond and one $\sigma$ bond

## Resonance and delocalisation
It is also related to [[Mainfolder/IBDP-Chemistry/Topics/Covalent structures\|Covalent structures]] we have a simple version of this concepts.

The bond in $\ce{O3}$ is equal:
$\ce{O-O=O}$ $\leftrightarrow$ $\ce{O=O-O}$ 
It is because the **delocalization** of a free electron
>Delocalisation is the sharing of a pair of electrons between three or more atoms.

## Absorption of ultraviolet light in the atmosphere
Ultraviolet (UV) light from the Sun reaching the Earth can be divided into three components:

- UV-C $λ$ < 280 $nm$ (highest energy)
- UV-B $λ$ = 280–320 $nm$
- UV-A $λ$ = 320–400 $nm$

UV radiation is absorbed by molecules of $\ce{O2}$ or $\ce{O3}$ as they undergo dissociation.
