**Hess's Law**
>The enthalpy change accompanying a chemical reaction is independent of the pathway between the initial and final states.![Screenshot 2023-08-11 at 1.47.00 PM.png|375](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Screenshot%202023-08-11%20at%201.47.00%20PM.png)

Hess law is very similar to the vector theory in physics topics see [[Mainfolder/IBDP-Physics/Physics Review/Topics/Measurements and uncertainties\|Measurements and uncertainties]].

### Example of Hess law:
If we have a reaction $$\ce{A->B }\ \ \ \Delta H_{r} $$
It can be breakdown into two process:
$$\ce{A->C}\ \ \ \Delta H_{1}$$
and$$\ce{C->B}\ \ \ \Delta H_{2}$$Then the enthalpy change is $\Delta H_{r}=\Delta H_{1}+\Delta H_{2}$

If the reaction is reversed, for example: $\ce{B->C}\ \ \ \Delta H_{2}$, then $\ce{C->B}\ \ \ -\Delta H_{2}$ .
The change of direction of reaction will change the enthalpy to it's opposite.
