## Heat and temperature
See [[Mainfolder/IBDP-Physics/Physics Review/Topics/Temperature and energy changes\|Temperature and energy changes]] to get definition of Temperature, heat and internal energy.

## Exothermic and endothermic reactions and enthalpy changes
>In an **exothermic reaction**, heat energy is transferred from a system (chemical reaction) to the surroundings.![Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 10.08.34 AM.png|350](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Screenshot%202023-08-09%20at%2010.08.34%20AM.png)

>In an **endothermic reaction**, a system (chemical reaction) takes in heat energy from the surroundings.![Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 10.08.51 AM.png|300](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Screenshot%202023-08-09%20at%2010.08.51%20AM.png)

>**enthalpy change**($\Delta \textbf{H}$) is basically the amount of heat energy taken in/given out in a chemical reaction.
>$$\Delta H_{total}=\Delta H_{products}-\Delta H_{reactants}$$

*Total energy is conserved in a chemical reaction.*

- Enthalpy change of exothermic and endothermic
	- Exo: $\Delta H<0$ 
		- Example: $\ce{CH4_{(g)} + 2O2_{(g)} -> CO2_{(g)} + 2H2O_{(l)}}\ \ \ \Delta H=-890kJmol^{-1}$
		- ![Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 10.16.39 AM.png](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Screenshot%202023-08-09%20at%2010.16.39%20AM.png)
	- Endo: $\Delta H>0$ 
		- Example: $\ce{N2_{(g)} + O2_{(g)} → 2NO_{(g)}}$     $\Delta H=181kJmol^{-1}$ 
		- ![Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 10.18.01 AM.png|425](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Screenshot%202023-08-09%20at%2010.18.01%20AM.png)

*The term stability is usually used to describe the relative energies of reactants and products in a chemical reaction. If the products have less energy than the reactants then they are more stable.*

>**standard conditions** is pressure= $100kPa$ 

Enthalpy under standard conditions note as $\Delta H^{\circ}$ 

- Different type of standard enthalpy
	- Standard enthalpy change of reaction $\Delta H^{\circ}_r$ 
		- the enthalpy change (heat given out or taken in) when molar amounts of reactants, react together under standard conditions to give products.
		- Example: ![Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 10.27.38 AM.png](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Screenshot%202023-08-09%20at%2010.27.38%20AM.png)
	- Standard enthalpy change of combustion $\Delta H^{\circ}_c$ 
		- the enthalpy change when **one mole of a substance** is completely burnt in oxygen under standard conditions.
		- Example: ![Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 10.28.06 AM.png](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Screenshot%202023-08-09%20at%2010.28.06%20AM.png)
	- Enthalpy change of neutralisation $\Delta H^{\circ}_n$
		- the enthalpy change when one mole of water molecules are formed when an acid ($\ce{H+}$) reacts with an alkali ($\ce{OH-}$) under standard conditions
		- Example: ![Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 10.32.08 AM.png](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Screenshot%202023-08-09%20at%2010.32.08%20AM.png)
	- Enthalpy change of solution $\Delta H^{\circ}_{sol}$ 
		- the enthalpy change when **one mole of solute** is dissolved in excess solvent to form a solution of **‘infinite dilution’** under standard conditions.(*‘Infinite dilution’ means that any further dilution of the solution produces no further enthalpy change – i.e. the solute particles are assumed not to interact with each other in the solution.*)
		- Example: $\ce{NH4NO3_{(s)} ->[excess H2O] NH4+_{(aq)} + NO3−_{(aq)}}$ $\Delta H^{\circ}_{sol}=25.7 kJ mol^{-1}$ 



## Measuring enthalpy changes
You can find definition of specific capacity in [[Mainfolder/IBDP-Physics/Physics Review/Topics/Temperature and energy changes\|Temperature and energy changes]]  

### Measuring an enthalpy change of combustion
The basic technique is called **calorimetry**. The idea is that the heat given out in a combustion reaction is used to heat another substance of known specific heat capacity, such as water.

## Enthalpy changes in solution

By the definition of $\Delta H^{\circ}_{sol}$ we can know the ability of solubility, it is also related to [[Mainfolder/IBDP-Chemistry/Topics/Intermolecular forces\|Intermolecular forces]].
