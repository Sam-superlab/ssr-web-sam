### **Linear Algebra Exam â€“ Chapter 1**

**Total Time**: 90 minutes  
**Total Marks**: 100

### **Part 1: Conceptual Questions (30 Marks)**

**1.** (10 marks)  
Define the following terms with examples:
- Vector space
- Subspace
- Direct sum

**2.** (10 marks)  
State and prove the distributive property of scalar multiplication over vector addition in a vector space. That is, prove:
$$ a(u + v) = au + av $$
for all $a \in F$ and $u, v \in V$.

**3.** (10 marks)  
Explain why the set of continuous real-valued functions on the interval $[0, 1]$ forms a vector space. Provide proof that it satisfies the necessary properties of a vector space.

### **Part 2: Short Problems (40 Marks)**

**4.** (8 marks)  
Let $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$ and $a + bi \in \mathbb{C}$. Find real numbers $c$ and $d$ such that:
$$ \frac{1}{a + bi} = c + di $$

**5.** (8 marks)  
Prove that for any $v \in V$ (a vector space), the additive inverse $-v$ is unique.

**6.** (8 marks)  
Let $V = F^3$ and consider the subset $U = \{(x_1, x_2, x_3) \in F^3 : x_1 + 2x_2 + 3x_3 = 0\}$. Prove that $U$ is a subspace of $F^3$.

**7.** (8 marks)  
Show that the set $\{(x_1, x_2, 0)\}$ in $F^3$ is a subspace of $F^3$.

**8.** (8 marks)  
Let $V = F^2$ and $W = \{(x_1, x_2) \in F^2 : x_1 = 0\}$. Is $V = V \oplus W$? Justify your answer.

### **Part 3: Long Problems (30 Marks)**

**9.** (15 marks)  
Let $U_1 = \{(x, 0, 0) \in F^3 : x \in F\}$ and $U_2 = \{(0, y, 0) \in F^3 : y \in F\}$.  
(a) Prove that $F^3 = U_1 \oplus U_2$.  
(b) Prove that the sum $U_1 + U_2$ is a direct sum.

**10.** (15 marks)  
Let $V = \mathbb{R}^3$ and consider the subspaces $U_1 = \{(x, 0, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3\}$ and $U_2 = \{(0, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^3\}$.  
(a) Prove that $V \neq U_1 \oplus U_2$.  
(b) Explain why this sum is not a direct sum.

### **Bonus Question (Optional, 10 Marks)**

**11.** (10 marks)  
Let $U_1$ and $U_2$ be subspaces of $F^3$ such that $U_1 \cap U_2 = \{0\}$. Prove that the sum $U_1 + U_2$ is a direct sum if and only if $U_1 \cap U_2 = \{0\}$.
