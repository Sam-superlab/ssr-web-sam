>The anti-derivative of this function is integration. $$\int f'(x)dx=f(x)+C$$
>you should always add a constant symbol $C$

For example: The integration of $x^n$ is $$\int x^{n}dx= \frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+C$$
## Formula of Integration
| Integration  | solution                |
| ------------ | ----------------------- |
| $\int 1 dx$  | $x+C$                   |
| $\int kdx$   | $kx+C$                  |
| $\int x^ndx$ | $\frac{x^{n+1}}{n+1}+C$ |
| $\int (ax+b)^ndx$             |                         |
