# Introduction to Set Theory

## Basic Definitions

### Set, Element, Subset
- **Set**: A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. The objects in a set are called **elements** or **members** of the set.
- **Element**: If $a$ is an object, we say $a$ is an **element** of a set $A$ if $a$ belongs to the set. This is denoted as $a \in A$.
- **Subset**: A set $A$ is called a **subset** of another set $B$ if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. This is denoted as $A \subseteq B$.

 Example:
Let $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$. Since every element of $A$ is also in $B$, we say $A$ is a subset of $B$: $A \subseteq B$.

### Empty Set
- **Empty Set**: The **empty set**, denoted by $\emptyset$, is the set that contains no elements. Formally:
$$
\emptyset = \{\}
$$

### Universal Set
- **Universal Set**: The **universal set** is the set that contains all possible elements for a particular discussion. It is typically denoted as $U$. All other sets are considered subsets of the universal set.

---

## Set Notation

### Roster Notation
- **Roster Notation**: A set is defined by explicitly listing all of its elements inside curly braces.
  - Example: $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ means that $A$ is the set containing the elements 1, 2, 3, and 4.

### Set-Builder Notation
- **Set-Builder Notation**: A set is defined by specifying a property that its members must satisfy.
  - Example: $A = \{x \mid x \text{ is an even number}\}$ defines the set $A$ as all even numbers.

---

## Membership and Inclusion

### Membership
- **Membership** is the relationship between an element and a set. If $a$ is an element of a set $A$, we say $a$ **belongs** to $A$ and write:
$$
a \in A
$$
If $a$ does not belong to $A$, we write:
$$
a \notin A
$$

### Subset and Inclusion
- **Subset**: A set $A$ is a subset of another set $B$ if every element of $A$ is also an element of $B$. This is denoted as:
$$
A \subseteq B
$$
- **Proper Subset**: $A$ is a proper subset of $B$, written $A \subset B$, if $A$ is a subset of $B$ but $A \neq B$.

 Example:
If $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{1, 2, 3\}$, then $A \subseteq B$ because all elements of $A$ are in $B$. However, $A \neq B$, so $A \subset B$ (proper subset).

---

## Venn Diagrams

- **Venn Diagrams**: A Venn diagram visually represents sets and their relationships. Each set is shown as a circle, and the relationships between the sets (such as intersections or unions) are depicted by the overlapping or non-overlapping areas of the circles.

### Common Venn Diagram Operations:
- **Intersection** ($A \cap B$): The set of elements common to both $A$ and $B$. Represented by the overlapping region of two circles.
- **Union** ($A \cup B$): The set of elements that belong to either $A$ or $B$. Represented by the entire area covered by both circles.
- **Complement** ($A^c$): The set of elements not in $A$, but in the universal set $U$.
- **Difference** ($A - B$): The set of elements in $A$ but not in $B$.

 Example:
If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$:
- $A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ (union)
- $A \cap B = \{3\}$ (intersection)
- $A - B = \{1, 2\}$ (difference)

Venn diagrams provide an intuitive way to visualize these set operations.

# Operations on Sets

### Union ( ∪ )
- **Union** of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of elements that are in either $A$ or $B$, or in both. The union operation is denoted by $A \cup B$.
$$
A \cup B = \{x \mid x \in A \text{ or } x \in B\}
$$
- **Example**: If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then:
$$
A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}
$$

---

### Intersection ( ∩ )
- **Intersection** of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of elements that are in both $A$ and $B$. The intersection operation is denoted by $A \cap B$.
$$
A \cap B = \{x \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \in B\}
$$
- **Example**: If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then:
$$
A \cap B = \{3\}
$$

---

### Difference ( A \ B )
- The **difference** of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of elements that are in $A$ but not in $B$. The difference is denoted by $A \setminus B$ or $A - B$.
$$
A \setminus B = \{x \mid x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B\}
$$
- **Example**: If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then:
$$
A \setminus B = \{1, 2\}
$$

---

### Complement ( A' )
- The **complement** of a set $A$ refers to all the elements that are not in $A$, but are in the universal set $U$. The complement of $A$ is denoted by $A'$ or $A^c$.
$$
A' = \{x \mid x \in U \text{ and } x \notin A\}
$$
- **Example**: If the universal set $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ and $A = \{1, 2\}$, then:
$$
A' = \{3, 4, 5\}
$$

---

### Symmetric Difference
- The **symmetric difference** of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of elements that are in either of the sets, but not in their intersection. It is denoted by $A \triangle B$.
$$
A \triangle B = (A \setminus B) \cup (B \setminus A)
$$
- **Example**: If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$, then:
$$
A \triangle B = \{1, 2, 4, 5\}
$$

---

### Cartesian Product
- The **Cartesian product** of two sets $A$ and $B$ is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. It is denoted by $A \times B$.
$$
A \times B = \{(a, b) \mid a \in A \text{ and } b \in B\}
$$
- **Example**: If $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{x, y\}$, then:
$$
A \times B = \{(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)\}
$$

---

### Pairs and Tuples
- **Pairs**: A **pair** is an ordered collection of two elements. For example, $(a, b)$ is a pair where the order matters—$(a, b) \neq (b, a)$ unless $a = b$.
- **Tuples**: A **tuple** is an ordered collection of elements. A **2-tuple** is just a pair, a **3-tuple** is called a **triple**, and so on. For example, $(a, b, c)$ is a **3-tuple**.

 Example of Pairs and Tuples:
- **Pair**: $(2, 3)$ where the order matters.
- **Triple**: $(1, 2, 3)$ where each element in the tuple is in a specific position.

# Basic Set Identities

## Commutative, Associative, and Distributive Laws

### Commutative Laws:
- The **commutative law** for union and intersection states that the order of sets does not affect the result of the operation.
$$
A \cup B = B \cup A
$$
$$
A \cap B = B \cap A
$$

### Associative Laws:
- The **associative law** for union and intersection states that the grouping of sets does not affect the result.
$$
(A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup (B \cup C)
$$
$$
(A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap (B \cap C)
$$

### Distributive Laws:
- The **distributive law** links union and intersection. It states that intersection distributes over union and vice versa.
$$
A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)
$$
$$
A \cup (B \cap C) = (A \cup B) \cap (A \cup C)
$$

---

## De Morgan’s Laws

- **De Morgan’s Laws** describe the complement of unions and intersections. These laws are very important for simplifying expressions involving complements.
$$
(A \cup B)' = A' \cap B'
$$
$$
(A \cap B)' = A' \cup B'
$$

 Example:
If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $B = \{3, 4, 5\}$ with universal set $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$, then:
- $A' = \{4, 5, 6\}$
- $B' = \{1, 2, 6\}$
- $(A \cup B)' = \{6\}$ and $A' \cap B' = \{6\}$, showing that De Morgan's law holds.

---

## Absorption and Idempotent Laws

### Absorption Laws:
- The **absorption law** simplifies expressions involving both union and intersection.
$$
A \cup (A \cap B) = A
$$
$$
A \cap (A \cup B) = A
$$

### Idempotent Laws:
- The **idempotent law** states that combining a set with itself does not change the set.
$$
A \cup A = A
$$
$$
A \cap A = A
$$

---

## Double Complement Law

- The **double complement law** states that the complement of the complement of a set is the set itself.
$$
(A')' = A
$$

 Example:
If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and the universal set $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$, then:
- $A' = \{4, 5\}$
- $(A')' = A = \{1, 2, 3\}$

---

## Proofs Using Venn Diagrams and Algebraic Techniques

### Proof with Venn Diagrams:
- **Venn Diagrams** provide a visual representation of set operations and are useful for proving identities.

#### Example: Prove De Morgan’s Law $(A \cup B)' = A' \cap B'$ using a Venn diagram:
1. Draw two overlapping circles representing sets $A$ and $B$.
2. Shade the area outside the union of $A$ and $B$ to represent $(A \cup B)'$.
3. Then, separately shade the intersection of $A'$ and $B'$ (the regions outside $A$ and $B$).
4. You will see that the shaded regions for both expressions are identical, proving the identity.

### Proof with Algebraic Techniques:
- Algebraic proofs involve manipulating set expressions step by step, using known identities.

#### Example: Prove the absorption law $A \cup (A \cap B) = A$:
1. Start with $A \cup (A \cap B)$.
2. By the distributive law, we have:
$$
A \cup (A \cap B) = (A \cup A) \cap (A \cup B)
$$
3. By the idempotent law, $A \cup A = A$, so:
$$
A \cup (A \cap B) = A \cap (A \cup B)
$$
4. By the absorption law again, $A \cap (A \cup B) = A$. Therefore:
$$
A \cup (A \cap B) = A
$$

### Example of De Morgan’s Law Using Algebraic Techniques:
- Start with $(A \cup B)'$. By De Morgan’s Law, this is equal to $A' \cap B'$. To prove:
1. $(A \cup B)'$ means all elements that are **not** in either $A$ or $B$.
2. $A' \cap B'$ means all elements that are **not** in $A$ **and** **not** in $B$.
3. Since both describe the same set (elements not in $A$ or $B$), they are equal, and thus:
$$
(A \cup B)' = A' \cap B'
$$
# Relations

## Definitions

### Ordered Pairs and Cartesian Products
- An **ordered pair** is a pair of elements $(a, b)$ where the order matters; $(a, b) \neq (b, a)$ unless $a = b$.
- The **Cartesian product** of two sets $A$ and $B$, denoted $A \times B$, is the set of all ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a \in A$ and $b \in B$:
$$
A \times B = \{(a, b) \mid a \in A \text{ and } b \in B\}
$$
- **Example**: If $A = \{1, 2\}$ and $B = \{x, y\}$, then:
$$
A \times B = \{(1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y)\}
$$

### Binary Relations
- A **binary relation** from a set $A$ to a set $B$ is a subset of the Cartesian product $A \times B$. If $R$ is a binary relation, we write $aRb$ to mean that $(a, b) \in R$.
- If $R \subseteq A \times A$, it is called a **binary relation on** $A$.

---

## Properties of Relations

### Reflexive Relations
- A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called **reflexive** if every element of $A$ is related to itself:
$$
\forall a \in A, (a, a) \in R
$$
- **Example**: If $A = \{1, 2\}$, the relation $R = \{(1, 1), (2, 2)\}$ is reflexive.

### Symmetric Relations
- A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called **symmetric** if whenever $aRb$, then $bRa$:
$$
\forall a, b \in A, (a, b) \in R \implies (b, a) \in R
$$
- **Example**: If $A = \{1, 2\}$, the relation $R = \{(1, 2), (2, 1)\}$ is symmetric.

### Antisymmetric Relations
- A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called **antisymmetric** if whenever $aRb$ and $bRa$, then $a = b$:
$$
\forall a, b \in A, (a, b) \in R \text{ and } (b, a) \in R \implies a = b
$$
- **Example**: If $A = \{1, 2\}$, the relation $R = \{(1, 1), (2, 2)\}$ is antisymmetric, because no two distinct elements are mutually related.

### Transitive Relations
- A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called **transitive** if whenever $aRb$ and $bRc$, then $aRc$:
$$
\forall a, b, c \in A, (a, b) \in R \text{ and } (b, c) \in R \implies (a, c) \in R
$$
- **Example**: If $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$ and $R = \{(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)\}$, the relation $R$ is transitive.

---

## Equivalence Relations
- A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called an **equivalence relation** if it is **reflexive**, **symmetric**, and **transitive**.
- **Example**: The relation "is equal to" on a set of numbers is an equivalence relation because:
  - It is reflexive: $a = a$.
  - It is symmetric: If $a = b$, then $b = a$.
  - It is transitive: If $a = b$ and $b = c$, then $a = c$.

### Equivalence Classes
- If $R$ is an equivalence relation on a set $A$, then the **equivalence class** of an element $a \in A$ is the set of all elements in $A$ that are related to $a$:
$$
[a] = \{b \in A \mid aRb\}
$$
- **Example**: For the equivalence relation "has the same remainder when divided by 3" on the set of integers, the equivalence class of 1 includes numbers like $\{1, 4, 7, 10, \dots\}$.

---

## Partition of a Set
- A **partition** of a set $A$ is a collection of non-empty, disjoint subsets of $A$ whose union is $A$.
- Each equivalence class induced by an equivalence relation forms a partition of the set.
- **Example**: If $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$, a partition of $A$ might be $\{\{1, 2\}, \{3, 4\}\}$.

---

## Partial and Total Orders

### Partial Orders
- A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is called a **partial order** if it is **reflexive**, **antisymmetric**, and **transitive**.
- A set with a partial order is called a **partially ordered set** or **poset**.
- **Example**: The "less than or equal to" relation $\leq$ on the set of integers is a partial order.

### Total Orders
- A partial order $R$ on a set $A$ is called a **total order** if every pair of elements in $A$ is comparable, i.e., for any $a, b \in A$, either $aRb$ or $bRa$.
- **Example**: The relation $\leq$ on the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ is a total order because any two numbers can be compared.

---

## Hasse Diagrams
- A **Hasse diagram** is a graphical representation of a finite partially ordered set.
- In a Hasse diagram:
  - Elements are represented by points.
  - There is a line from $a$ to $b$ if $aRb$ and there is no element $c$ such that $aRc$ and $cRb$.
  - The diagram omits arrows, assuming that lines go upward (i.e., $aRb$ means $b$ is above $a$).
  
 Example:
For the set $A = \{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ with the partial order $R = \leq$, the Hasse diagram would look like this:
