## Power Series

A power series is an infinite series of the form:
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n (x - a)^n
$$
Where $a$ is the center of the series, and $c_n$ are the coefficients. The series converges within a certain interval known as the **radius of convergence**.

### Example:
The power series for $\frac{1}{1 - x}$ is:
$$
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} x^n = 1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + \dots
$$
This series converges for $|x| < 1$.
