### Capacitors: Overview

1. **Definition**: A capacitor is an arrangement of parallel plates separated by an insulator (dielectric). Common dielectrics include vacuum, air, or non-conducting materials like plastic. Capacitors store electrical energy in the form of an electric field between their plates.

2. **Basic Operation**: When a capacitor is connected to a voltage source, one plate accumulates positive charge (+Q), and the other an equal amount of negative charge (-Q). Despite having opposite charges on each plate, the charge stored in the capacitor is considered as Q, not 2Q.

### Capacitance

1. **Formula**: Capacitance (C) is given by $C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}$, where:
   - $\epsilon$ is the permittivity of the dielectric material between the plates.
   - $A$ is the area of overlap of the plates.
   - $d$ is the separation between the plates.

2. **Parallel-Plate Capacitor**: The capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor can be calculated using the formula mentioned above. Real capacitors may have reduced capacitance due to edge effects, where field distortions at the edges of plates lead to discrepancies from the theoretical values.

### Applications and Practical Aspects

1. **Uses in Circuits**: Capacitors are widely used in electronic circuits to store charge, stabilize voltage and current, and as part of timing circuits.

2. **Energy Storage**: The energy stored in a charged capacitor is given by $E= \frac{1}{2} CV^2$, where $V$ is the voltage across the capacitor.

### Discharging and Time Constant

1. **Exponential Discharge**: The discharge of a capacitor through a resistor follows an exponential decay pattern. The charge $Q$ on the capacitor at any time during discharge can be calculated using appropriate exponential formulas.

2. **Time Constant**: The time constant of an RC circuit (Ï„) is given by $\tau = RC$. It represents the time taken for the charge to reduce to about 37% of its initial value.

### Combinations of Capacitors

1. **Parallel Combination**: When capacitors are connected in parallel, the total capacitance is the sum of the individual capacitances: $C_{\text{parallel}} = C_1 + C_2 + \ldots$.

2. **Series Combination**: For capacitors in series, the reciprocal of the total capacitance is the sum of the reciprocals of individual capacitances: $\frac{1}{C_{\text{series}}} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + \ldots$.
