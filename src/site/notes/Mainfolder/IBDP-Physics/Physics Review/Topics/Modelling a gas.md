## Ideal Gas law
$$PV=nRT$$
### Boyle’s law
Boyle’s law states that for a fixed mass of gas at constant temperature the pressure is inversely proportional to the volume.
$$P\propto \frac{1}{V}$$
### Charles Law
Charles is now stated as for a fixed mass of gas at constant pressure the volume is directly proportional to the absolute temperature.
$$V\propto T$$
### The third gas law
The third gas law is stated as for a gas of fixed mass and volume, the pressure is directly proportional to the absolute temperature.
$$P\propto T$$
We now state this as the number of particles in a gas at constant temperature and pressure is directly proportional to the volume of the gas.
$$n\propto V$$

equation of state of an ideal gas:
$$PV=nRT$$
Where:
$R=8.314JK^{-1}mol^{-1}$
