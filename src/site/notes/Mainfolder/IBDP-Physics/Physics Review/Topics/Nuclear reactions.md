## Nuclear decay
>[! important] 
>Nuclear decay is Random and spontaneous 
## Alpha particle addition
>[!note] $\ce{^{m}_{z}X + ^{4}_{2}He -> ^{m+4}_{z+2}Y}$$

## Beta decay
>[!note] 
>Electron
>$$\ce{^{m}_{z}X -> ^{m}_{z+1}Y + ^{0}_{-1}e + ^{0}_0\bar{\nu} }$$
Positron
$$\ce{^{m}_{z}X -> ^{m}_{z-1}Y + ^{0}_{+1}e + ^{0}_0\nu }$$
## The unified atomic mass unit(1u)
>The unified atomic mass unit is create for simplify the calculation of the mass of the nuclei. Using carbon-12 atom as our standard of precisely 12.000000$u$

$$1u=1.661\times 10^{-27}kg=931.5 \text{MeV}c^-2$$
## Mass defect($\Delta m$)
> Mass defect is the difference between reactants and products

>Binding energy $E_b$ of a nucleus is the amount of work or energy that must be expended to pill it apart---base on strong force

$J$ is too big hence some times we use $eV$ or $MeV$ as energy

$$1eV=1.6\times 10^{-19}J$$
 >Average binding energy is binding energy per nucleon(Mass number) $$\frac{E_{b}}{A}$$
 
 $\ce{Fe}$ is the most stable element, hence element before Fe will occur fusion and fater Fe is fission.
 ## Fission and Fusion
 >Fission will create 2 more neutrons which will cause a chain reaction
