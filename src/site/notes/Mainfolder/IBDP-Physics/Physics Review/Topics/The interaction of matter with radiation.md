Sure, here are the revised notes on the Photoelectric Effect with the adjustments to the mathematical notation:

### Notes on the Photoelectric Effect

1. **Einstein's Photoelectric Equation**: 
   - Einstein articulated the photoelectric effect with the equation $E_{\text{max}} = hf - \Phi$.
   - Here, $E_{\text{max}}$ represents the maximum kinetic energy of the emitted electron.
   - $hf$ is the energy of the incident photon.
   - $\Phi$ is the work function of the metal, the minimum energy required to remove an electron from the surface of the material.

2. **Basic Principles**:
   - Light consists of photons, each with energy $hf$, where $h$ is Planck's constant and $f$ is the frequency of the light.
   - Each photon can only interact with a single electron.
   - There exists a threshold frequency ($f_0$) below which no electrons are emitted regardless of the intensity of light.
   - The work function ($\Phi$) is the energy needed to overcome the attractive forces on an electron within the metal.
   - Any additional energy from the photon converts into the kinetic energy of the emitted electron (photoelectron).

3. **Contradiction with Wave Theory**:
   - The wave theory of light fails to explain the photoelectric effect because it suggests that light's energy is continuously distributed, and sufficient time and intensity should allow any frequency of light to eject an electron.
   - However, experiments show that no electrons are emitted below the threshold frequency regardless of light intensity, and electrons are ejected immediately above this threshold. This contradicts the wave theory's prediction and supports the particle theory of light.

4. **Einstein’s Equation Rearranged**:
   - Einstein's equation can be rearranged to $eV_s = hf - hf_0$, where $V_s$ is the stopping potential, and $f_0$ is the threshold frequency.
   - Further, rearrangement leads to $eV_s = \frac{hc}{\lambda} - \frac{hc}{\lambda_0}$, with $\lambda$ being the wavelength of the incident light and $\lambda_0$ the threshold wavelength.






## De Broglie Wave
>[!Hypothesis ]
>De Broglie claims that any particle have a momentum $p$ will have a wave associated with having a wavelength $\lambda$ of $\frac{h}{p}$. Statement in function:$$\lambda= \frac{h}{p}= \frac{h}{mv}$$

## Bohr's model of Hydrogen Atom
>[!Bohr's Model ]
>Bohr have a hypothesis of the orbital radius of hydrogen atom$$r_{n}=n^{2} \frac{h^{2}}{4\pi^{2}ke^{2}m}$$
>For energy it is$$E_{n}= \frac{-13.6eV}{n^{2}}$$
>And the Angular momentum: $$L=mvr=n \frac{h}{2\pi}$$




### Uncertainty Principle
$$\Delta x\Delta p\leq \frac{h}{4\pi}$$




## Wave function
### Schrödinger Equation
Schrödinger Equation is used to correct the Bohr's model:$$\frac{-h}{2m} \frac{\partial^{2}\Psi}{\partial\pi^{2}}+V\Psi = ih \frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t}$$
The wave function:$$\Psi(x)$$
Has no meaning, but $$|\Psi(x)|^{2}=\text{Probaility }$$
At the same time $$n\lambda = 2\pi r_n$$


## Schodinger's Quantum Mechanics
- $n$ principle quantum number(Energy levels)
- $l$ angular momentum quantum number (shape of orbitals)
- $m$ magnetic quantum number(Orientation) 
- ($-l\leq m\leq l$)
