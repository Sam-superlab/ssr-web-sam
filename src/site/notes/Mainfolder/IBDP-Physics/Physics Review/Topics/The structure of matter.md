## Elementary Particles - The standard Model
>[!note ] Leptons(Weak force)
>Leptons is a family of six particles, they are:
>1. $e^-$ electron
>2. $\nu_e$ Neutrino
>3. $\mu^-$ Muon
>4. $\nu_\mu$ neutrino
>5. $\tau^-$ Tau
>6. $\nu_\tau$ Neutrino


>[!note ]
Each of the particle list above have their antiparticle, for example $e^+$ which is positron

>Every Lepton give out an Lepton number where particle have 1
>Every Anti-Lepton have number -1


## Quarks (Naming)
- Up quark 
- Down quark
- strange Quark
- charm Quark
- Bottom Quark
- Top Quark

### Baryon Number of Quarks
| $\frac{1}{3}$ | $- \frac{1}{3}$   |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| $u,d$         | $\bar{u},\bar{d}$ |
| $c,s$         | $\bar{c},\bar{s}$ |
| $t,b$         | $\bar{t},\bar{b}$ |

### Strangeness of Strange Quarks
$s$ have -1
$\bar{s}$ have 1
others have 0

>[!note] Strangeness and Strong & weak nuclear force
>If strangeness number is conserved then the reactions are strong nuclear force
>If is not conserved then it is weak nuclear force

## Combination of Quarks
>[!definition ]
>Quarks combine in just two ways to form other particles called **hadrons**
>

>[!theorem ]
>There are two types of Hadrons: 
>1. Baryon, where combined by 3 quarks(All anti-quark or all quark)
>2. Meson, where combined by 2 quarks(One anti-quark and one quark)
>

>[!important] 
>Proton and Neutron's Quark combination
>Proton is formed by ($uud$)
>Neutron is formed by ($udd$)

## Quark Confinement
>[!theorem ]
>Moving a quark from its neighbors in the baryon or meson requires increasing amounts of energy to increase their separation. But the force does not break but produces new quarks.

## Conservations in nuclear reactions
1. Elementary charge
2. Lepton number
3. Baryon number
