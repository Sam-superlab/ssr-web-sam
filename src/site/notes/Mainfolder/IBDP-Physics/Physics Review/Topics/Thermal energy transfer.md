## Introduction
>Thermal energy can be transferred from a warmer mass to a cooler mass  by three means: conduction, convection and radiation$$E_{T_{1}}\to E_{T_{2}},T_{1}>T_{2}$$


## Conduction
>Thermal Conduction is the vibration of atom or molecules to transfer the energy and temperature.
>- It can occur in all solid liquid gas![Thermal Conduction - Key Stage Wiki](https://keystagewiki.com/images/1/1d/ThermalConduction.gif)



Note that Metals are good heat conductors because they have lots of **free electrons**


## Convection
>Convection is the flow of material. 
>- It can occur in liquid, gas

- Solarspots is an example of Convection
- Mantle convection is another example

## Thermal Radiation
**Thermal radiation can transfer without any medium in physics**. Therefore it is the major way to transfer energy in space.

>Thermal Radiation is a kind of Infra-Red radiation.

**solids can absorb many more wavelengths than the atmospheric gases, different color will absorb different type of radiation**

>Black-body Radiation--Black body will absorb all wavelength

*The high the temperature the smaller the wavelength of the maximum intensity* 
This is called: **Wien's displacement law**
![Wien's displacement law - Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a2/Wiens_law.svg/1200px-Wiens_law.svg.png)
>**Wien's displacement law** show that the wavelength of maximum intensity $\lambda_{max}$ for blackbodies at temperature in Kelvin$$\lambda_{max}=2.9\times 10^{-3}\times \frac{1}{T}$$

>**Stefan-Boltzmenn law** shows the relationship between the temperature of a black body and the power emitted the black body's surface area$$P=\sigma A T^4$$ where $\sigma=5.67\times 10^{-8}$

Base on the definition of intensity see [[Mainfolder/IBDP-Physics/Physics Review/Concepts/intensity\|intensity]] we can calculate most of the intensity of solar, which name as solar constant.

>The intensity of of the surface perpendicular to the sun light 

>**Emissivity(e)** of a body is a number between 0 and 1 that quantifies the emission and absorption properties of that body **compared to a blackbody of equal size** $$e=\frac{P_{body}}{P_{Blackbody}}=\frac{P_{body}}{\sigma A T^{4}}$$


- *The blackbody is a perfect emitter where $e=1$*
- Earth has emissivity $e=0.61$ 

### Albedo
>Is the ratio of scattered and incident$$Albedo=\frac{P_{scattered}}{P_{incident}}$$

- The Earth $\alpha=30\%$ 
- The power emission equal to power absorption where the temperature is constant 


## Greenhouse effect
There are some Green house gases:
- Methane
- Water vapor
- Carbon dioxide
- Nitrous oxide

### The absorption of IR by Greenhouse Gases
- Vibration refer to the molecules oscillating in conjunction with the springs 

### Energy Balance in Earth surface
$$I_{avg}=340Wm^{-2}$$
The average incident solar radiation

*The greenhouse gases will absorb some energy from solar, hence there are less energy that absorb by the ground, at the same time, because of the existence of greenhouse gases, while the ground is emission the energy back to the space, gases will still absorb some of the energy.*
