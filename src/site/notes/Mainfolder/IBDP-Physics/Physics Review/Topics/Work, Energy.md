## Work
Work down by $F$ can be depress as:
$$W=Fs\times cos (\theta)$$
## Energy
### Kinetic energy
Kinetic energy is the energy an object has because of its motion; kinetic energy (sometimes abbreviated to KE) has its own symbol, $E_K$ . Objects gain kinetic energy when their speed increases.
$$E_{K}= \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
Where $m$ is mass and $v$ is velocity.
### Gravitational potential energy, GPE
Gravitational potential energy is the energy an object has because of its position in a gravitational field.
$$E_{P}= mg\Delta h$$
It will further explained in [[Mainfolder/IBDP-Physics/Physics Review/Topics/Circular motion and gravitation\|Circular motion and gravitation]] and [[Mainfolder/IBDP-Physics/Physics Review/Topics/Fields (HL)\|Fields (HL)]].
