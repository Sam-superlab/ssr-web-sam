## Definition
Kinship studies - also known as family or pedigree studies - were a first step in determining whether a behavior or psychological disorder "runs in families."

## Features
Kinship studies have several basic characteristics:

- They measure the frequency of a behavior across generations.
- They measure the frequency of a behavior within a generation.
- They are often longitudinal.
- They use **case-control studies**. Case-control studies are retrospective. They clearly define two groups at the start: one with the behavior/disorder and one without the behavior/disorder. They look back to assess whether there is a statistically significant difference in the rates of exposure to a defined risk factor between the groups - in this case, to potential genetic inheritance.

## Evaluating kinship studies

- Kinship studies limit the overall genetic variability of the sample which increases the statistical power of any ge discovery.
- Kinship studies are more controlled than studies of unrelated people. They have all lived in the same home, shared a common diet, and often have the same level of physical activity.
- It is often difficult to obtain reliable data that goes back more than one generation. Kinship studies are often reliant on anecdotal data with regard to the behaviour of grandparents or great-grandparents. This data may be open to memory distortion.  More importantly, it is only recently that a diagnosis of psychological disorders is obtained.  In many cases of past generations, there are assumptions made about potential diagnoses - but no clinical data that can be used.
