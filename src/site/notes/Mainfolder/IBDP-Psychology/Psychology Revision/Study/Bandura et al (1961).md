**Aim:**

To see if observational learning (or in the larger scheme of things social cognitive theory) can influence behavior

**Procedure:**
Participants: Children aged 3 to 6 years (36 boys and 36 girls).
1. Group division: Children were divided into three groups, matched for aggression levels based on evaluations by nursery school teachers.
    - Group 1: Exposed to adult models displaying aggression towards an inflatable "Bobo" doll through physical bashing.
    - Group 2: Exposed to adult models displaying aggression towards the Bobo doll through verbal aggression.
    - Group 3: A control group that did not observe any model.
2. Same-sex and opposite-sex models: Within the first and second groups, some children watched same-sex models, while others observed opposite-sex models.
3. Experimental setup:
    - Children watched the models and were then placed in a room with toys.
    - They were later informed that the toys were meant for other children, inducing frustration.
    - Subsequently, the children were placed in the room with the Bobo doll.
4. Observation: The children's behaviors were recorded through a one-way mirror.

**Results:**

1. Children who observed aggressive models (either physically or verbally) displayed significantly higher levels of aggression, both physically and verbally.
2. Observational learning was evident, indicating that the children imitated the aggressive behaviors they witnessed.
3. In terms of imitating same-sex models, boys were more likely to imitate physical aggression, while girls were more likely to imitate verbal aggression.
4. Boys often made comments like "Ladies shouldn't do that!" when witnessing women engaging in physical aggression, suggesting a preference for same-sex adult models.

**Conclusion:**

1. Children are prone to imitating aggression observed in adult models.
2. The findings support the theory of observational learning, indicating that children learn behavior by observing and imitating others.
3. The study demonstrates that imitative behavior is influenced by the sex of the model, with children tending to imitate the behaviors of same-sex adults.

**Evaluation:**

1. Strengths:
    - The study employed a controlled experimental design, allowing for the establishment of cause-and-effect relationships.
    - The use of matched groups based on aggression levels by nursery school teachers increased the validity of the findings.
    - The observations were conducted behind a one-way mirror, minimizing the potential for demand characteristics.
2. Limitations:
    - The study focused on a specific age range (3 to 6 years), limiting the generalizability of the findings to other age groups.
    - The use of an inflatable doll (Bobo doll) may not accurately represent real-life aggression scenarios.
    - The study only examined the immediate effects of aggression modeling and did not investigate long-term consequences.
    - Ethical considerations: The study exposed children to aggressive models, potentially causing distress or promoting aggressive behavior.
