## Aim
To see if people, when given something unfamiliar to remember, would alter information.
## Participants
The participants were asked to read an old Native American Legend called 'The War of the Ghosts.' Later, they were asked to recall the story, and this was repeated over the following weeks.

## Procedure
The participants were asked to read an old Native American Legend called 'The War of the Ghosts'. Later, they were asked to recall the story, and this was repeated over the following weeks.

## Result
Participants found it difficult to remember bits of the story <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">concerned with spirits and changed other parts so it made more sense to them.</mark> <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Each Time they retold the story it changed more.</mark>


## Conclusion
Our memory is influenced by our <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">beliefs (schemes)</mark>


## Critical thinking: 
**Lacks internal validity**: This is because of extraneous variables at play during the study, e.g., The mood of the participants and the time of the day. These variables affect the dependent variable, which alters the results, making them inaccurate.
**Lacks population validity**: This is because Bartlett only used British people, meaning we cannot generalize the results to other populations like Germans or Indians as they may have acted differently.
