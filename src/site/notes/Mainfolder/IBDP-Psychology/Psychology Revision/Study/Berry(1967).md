### Study of Cultural Dimensions: Temne and Eskimo Comparison

#### Aim

To explore the differences in conformity levels between the Temne people of Sierra Leone and the Baffin Island Eskimo, focusing on the impact of cultural influences.

#### Participants

- **Temne (Collectivist Culture)**:
    - Traditional Group: 90 participants without Western education.
    - Transitional Group: 32 participants adapting to Western life.
- **Eskimo (Individualist Culture)**:
    - Traditional Group: 91 participants without Western education.
    - Transitional Group: 31 participants adapting to Western life.

#### Procedure

- **Adaptation of Asch's Experiment**: Participants were shown 9 lines and asked to identify the line closest in length to a reference line.
- **Conformity Test**: Participants were informed that most others chose a specific line (marked with 'x'), which was not the correct match, to gauge conformity.

#### Results

- **Higher Conformity in Temne**: The Temne participants, particularly the traditional group, showed significantly higher conformity scores.
- **Lower Conformity in Eskimos**: The Eskimo participants, including both traditional and transitional groups, demonstrated lower conformity scores compared to the Temne and even lower than a Scottish sample used for comparison.
- **Urban vs. Rural**: Transitional and urban participants showed lower conformity levels compared to their traditional and rural counterparts.
