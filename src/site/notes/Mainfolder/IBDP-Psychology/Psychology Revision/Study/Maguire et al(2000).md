### Study Note: Maguire et al. (2000) - Taxi Drivers and the Hippocampus

#### Aim

The study aimed to examine whether structural changes could be detected in the brains of people with extensive experience in spatial navigation, specifically London taxi drivers who had undergone extensive training known as 'The Knowledge'.

#### Procedure

- **Method**: Structural MRI scans were used.
- **Participants**: 16 right-handed male London taxi drivers with more than 1.5 years of experience. For comparison, scans of 50 healthy right-handed males who did not drive taxis were included.
- **Age**: The mean age did not differ significantly between the two groups.

#### Results

1. **Increased Grey Matter**: Taxi drivers showed increased grey matter in two brain regions, the right and left hippocampi, particularly in the posterior (rear) hippocampus.
2. **Correlation with Experience**: There was a positive correlation between the amount of time spent as a taxi driver and the volume in the right posterior hippocampus.

#### Conclusion

The study concluded that there are structural differences in the hippocampi of London taxi drivers compared to control participants. This suggests that extensive practice with spatial navigation affects the hippocampus, indicating the brain's plasticity in response to environmental stimuli.

#### Critical Thinking

- **Implications for Brain Plasticity**: The study provides strong evidence for the brain's ability to undergo structural changes in response to environmental demands, particularly in adult life.
- **Potential for a Mental Map**: The results suggest that the mental map of London is stored in the posterior hippocampus and accommodated by an increase in tissue volume.
- **Consideration of Predisposition**: The study raises the question of whether the particular arrangement of hippocampal grey matter predisposes individuals to professions that rely heavily on navigational skills.
