### Study Note: McClintock (1971) - Menstrual Synchrony

#### Aim

Martha McClintock's 1971 study aimed to **investigate the phenomenon of menstrual synchrony among women living in close proximity.**

#### Procedure

- **Setting**: The study was conducted at Wellesley College.
- **Participants**: Female college students living in a dormitory.
- **Method**: McClintock observed and recorded the menstrual cycles of these women over a period of time.

#### Results

- **Observation of Synchrony**: McClintock reported that women living together or who were close friends tended to synchronize their menstrual cycles.
- **Proposed Mechanism**: She suggested that this synchrony was due to the influence of pheromones, with two opposing types: one that shortens cycles and one that lengthens them.

#### Conclusion

The study concluded that there is a significant synchronization of menstrual cycles among women who live together, potentially influenced by pheromones.

#### Critical Thinking

- **Innovative Approach**: McClintock's study was pioneering in the field of human pheromones and menstrual synchrony, opening new avenues for research in female reproductive biology.
- **Controversy and Critique**: The study has been subject to criticism, particularly regarding its methodology and the validity of its findings. Critics have pointed out errors in mathematical calculations and data collection, and some have questioned the very existence of menstrual synchrony.
- **Impact on Further Research**: Despite criticisms, the study has had a lasting impact on the field, prompting further research into the role of pheromones in human behavior and reproductive biology.

## Relationship of EST and study
**Social Influences on Biological Processes**: McClintock's study, which suggests that women living in close proximity may synchronize their menstrual cycles, aligns with EST's emphasis on the interplay between social factors and biological processes. EST posits that social interactions can have significant evolutionary and biological implications, and menstrual synchrony could be an example of this interaction.
