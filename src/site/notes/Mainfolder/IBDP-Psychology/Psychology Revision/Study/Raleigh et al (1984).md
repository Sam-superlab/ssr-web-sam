## Aim
Understand the relationship between serotonin levels and a person's social status.
## Method
Natural experiment, test on Vervet Monkeys
## Procedure
Divided the Vervet monkeys into groups containing three males, three females, and their offspring. After 5 months of captivity, the monkeys were categorized as either dominant(Leader) or submissive(followed by the leader). To make sure their results were accurate, they removed the dominant monkeys from their groups.
## Findings
The monkeys that became dominant had a 60% increase in serotonin levels, while the ones that became submissive had a 40% decrease in serotonin levels.

## Conclusion
Natural Selection would have helped the submissive ancestors to avoid fights with stronger opponents and, therefore survive to pass down that beneficial gene(Evolutional Psy)



## Strength 
- the use of a pre-test/post-test design, they measured the serotonin levels of the male monkeys before the changes in the social hierarchy occurred  
- demonstrates that changes in the hierarchical position as opposed to the monkey's losing one's rank due to a drop in serotonin  
- add validity to the claim that depressive behaviors may be rooted in the loss of social status (eliminates the problem of bidirectional ambiguity)
## Limitations
- based on the assumptions that serotonin is the cause of depression in humans  
- serotonin hypothesis is highly contested  
- research does not look at the role of other neurotransmitters or hormones in depressive behaviour  
- link to human depression may be limited  
- does not consider the social lies of humans are far more complex that those of monkeys, suggesting the need for caution when generalizing findings to human behaviour  
- does not address cognitive factors role when faced with loss of position (important point as humans are capable of reframing a social loss as gain)
