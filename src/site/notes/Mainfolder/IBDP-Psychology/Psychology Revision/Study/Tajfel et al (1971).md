### Tajfel et al. (1971) Study Overview

#### Aim

The study aimed to investigate if mere **categorization into groups** is sufficient to induce **discriminatory behavior among individuals.**

#### Method
- **Participants**: The study involved schoolboys who were randomly assigned to different groups.
- **Procedure**: The boys were categorized based on trivial criteria (e.g., preference for paintings by Kandinsky or Klee). Participants were asked to allocate points to members of their own group (in-group) and the other group (out-group).

#### Results
- **In-group Favoritism**: Tajfel et al. found that participants tended to favor members of their own group over those in the out-group.
- **Discrimination**: The study revealed a tendency for intergroup discrimination based solely on group membership, even when the group assignment was arbitrary and meaningless.

#### Conclusion
The study concluded that mere categorization into groups is enough to trigger in-group favoritism and out-group discrimination. This phenomenon was later termed the "minimal group paradigm."

#### Methodological Considerations
- **Random Assignment and Control**: The study's strength lies in its random assignment of participants to groups, which minimizes pre-existing differences. However, the artificial nature of the groups and tasks may limit the ecological validity of the findings.
- **Simplicity of Task**: While the simplicity of the point allocation task ensures clarity and focus on group behavior, it may not accurately reflect the complexities of real-world group dynamics and discrimination.

#### Ethical Implications

- **Inducing Discrimination**: The study intentionally creates a situation where participants discriminate against others. This raises ethical questions about the potential psychological impact on participants, especially considering they were schoolboys.
