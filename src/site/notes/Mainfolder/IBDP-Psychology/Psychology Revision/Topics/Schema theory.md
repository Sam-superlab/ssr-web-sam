## Definition
[[Mainfolder/IBDP-Psychology/Psychology Revision/Concepts/Schema\|Schema]] theory is a branch of cognitive science concerned with how the brain structures knowledge.
### Overview

- **Definition**: Schema theory suggests that all knowledge is organized into units. A schema is a cognitive framework or concept that helps organize and interpret information in the brain.
- **Origin**: The concept was introduced by British psychologist Frederic Bartlett and further developed by Jean Piaget, a Swiss developmental psychologist.

### Function

- **Mental Frameworks**: Schemas are mental structures that help individuals understand the world. They are developed based on experiences and are constantly modified as we gain more information.
- **Role in Learning and Memory**: Schemas influence attention, learning, and memory. They help in encoding, storing, and retrieving information.
- **Predicting and Interpreting**: They enable us to predict and interpret new experiences by filling in gaps in our knowledge.

### Types of Schemas

- **Person Schemas**: Ideas about what different kinds of people are like.
- **Self-Schemas**: Ideas about the self that guide processing of self-relevant information.
- **Role Schemas**: Based on jobs or positions people hold in society.
- **Event Schemas (Scripts)**: Knowledge about routines or sequences of events.

### Development and Modification

- **Formation**: Schemas are formed based on experiences and are influenced by culture.
- **Modification**: They are dynamic and can change with new information or experiences. This process involves assimilation (fitting new information into existing schemas) and accommodation (changing schemas to fit new information).

### Applications and Implications

- **Education**: Understanding schemas can aid in designing effective teaching strategies.
- **Understanding Bias**: Schemas can lead to stereotypes and biases, as they influence how we process information about people and events.

### Criticisms

- **Vagueness**: Some critics argue that the theory is too vague and lacks specificity.
- **Overemphasis on Consistency**: There's a concern that schema theory overemphasizes the consistency of cognitive processes.

### Conclusion

Schema theory provides a valuable framework for understanding how knowledge is structured and used in the brain, influencing various cognitive processes such as perception, memory, and learning. However, like any theory, it has its limitations and areas of debate.
