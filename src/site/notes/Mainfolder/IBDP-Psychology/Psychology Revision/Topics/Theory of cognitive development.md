Piaget's theory of cognitive development uses the stages in which **children’s development progresses through a series of cognitive stages,** with **each stage having distinctly different qualities**. He saw the stages as a way to describe changes in the logic of thinking. These are **Sensorimotor intelligence (age 0–2 years)** which children get knowledge by touching eating and feeling, **Pre-operational thought (age 2–7 years)** which children are egocentric, **Concrete operational thought (age 7–12 years)** which children start to use logic to solve questions by randomly not systematically, **Formal operations (from age 12)** children can use abstract concepts.
