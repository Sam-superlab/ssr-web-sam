## Social Cognitive theory
assumes that humans learn behavior through observational learning—in other words, people can learn by watching models and imitating their behavior.

## Extra information
According to Bandura, social cognitive learning involves the following **cognitive factors**.

- **Attention**: To learn a behavior, the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">learner must pay attention to the model</mark>.  Certain factors may influence whether attention is paid to the model, including the attractiveness of the model, the authority of the model, or the desirability of the behavior.
- **Retention**: The observer must <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">be able to remember the behavior</mark> that has been observed to produce that behavior immediately or after some time.
- **Motivation**: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Learners must want to replicate the behavior that they have observed</mark>.  To do this, they must understand what the potential outcome is if they repeat the behavior – what Bandura called _outcome expectancies_.
- **Potential**: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">In order to reproduce an observed behavior, observers must physically and/or mentally be able to carry out the behavior</mark> - that is, there needs to be a certain level of self-efficacy.

## Issue
The child might learn something from watching a model but may not exhibit that behavior for some time. Because this gap exists between when one observes the model and when one may demonstrate the behavior, it is difficult to establish 100 percent that the behavior is the result of observing the model.
