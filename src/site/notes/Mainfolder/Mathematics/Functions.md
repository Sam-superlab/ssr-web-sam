## Some continuous functions
>[!note] $\exp x$  is function that called exp function where the definiton of it is $$\exp(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{x^{k}}{k!}$$
>And we define natural constant $e$ as $\exp (0)$

***Therefore we shall see that any smooth function can be described as a series form which is Taylor series***
