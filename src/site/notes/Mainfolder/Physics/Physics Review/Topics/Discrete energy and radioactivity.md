### 7.1 â€“ Discrete Energy and Radioactivity: Detailed Overview with Equations

#### Discrete Energy Levels
- **Concept**: Atoms have specific energy levels where their electrons can reside, known as quantized energy states.
- **Energy Transitions**: Electrons absorb or emit energy in the form of photons when transitioning between these levels.

#### Equations and Concepts
1. **Energy of a Photon**: 
   $$ E = h \nu $$
   - Where \( E \) is the energy of the photon, \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \) Js), and \( \nu \) is the frequency of the photon.
2. **Energy Level Transition**: 
   $$ \Delta E = E_2 - E_1 = h \nu $$
   - \( \Delta E \) is the change in energy, \( E_2 \) and \( E_1 \) are the energy levels the electron transitions to and from, respectively.

#### Emission and Absorption Spectra
- **Emission Spectrum**: Lines at specific frequencies in a spectrum when an electron falls to a lower energy level and emits a photon.
- **Absorption Spectrum**: Dark lines in a spectrum where light at specific frequencies has been absorbed by electrons moving to higher energy levels.

#### Radioactive Decay
- **Nature of Decay**: Spontaneous emission of particles or electromagnetic radiation from unstable nuclei.
- **Types of Decay**:
  - Alpha decay: Emission of an alpha particle (helium nucleus).
  - Beta decay: Emission of a beta particle (electron or positron).
  - Gamma decay: Emission of gamma radiation (high-energy photons).

#### Half-Life
- **Definition**: Time for half the radioactive nuclei in a sample to decay.
- **Equation**: 
  $$ N(t) = N_0 \times \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{t}{T_{1/2}}} $$
  - Where \( N(t) \) is the number of undecayed nuclei at time \( t \), \( N_0 \) is the initial number of nuclei, and \( T_{1/2} \) is the half-life of the substance.

#### Practical Applications and Implications
- **Medical Imaging**: Gamma rays are used in diagnostic imaging techniques like PET scans.
- **Radiometric Dating**: Determines the age of archaeological samples by measuring radioactive isotope decay.
- **Nuclear Energy**: Based on nuclear fission principles, where heavy nuclei split and release energy.
