## Type of Energy sources
### Primary Energy Sources
- Oil
	- Oil is the most common energy source that used in human's daily life.
- Coal
- Gas
- Wood
- Biomass
- Hydrogen
- Uranium
- Chemical


### Secondary Energy Sources
- Electricity

### Renewable and non-renewable energy
>Renewable energy sources are sources that will not run out.

>Non-renewable will run out.


## Energy density and Specific energy of fuel
**Energy Density** :
>$$\frac{energy}{volume}\ J/m^3$$

**Specific energy**
>$$\frac{Energy}{mass}\ J/kg$$

- **For Gases they have high specific energy but low energy density.**
- **For coal they have high energy density but low specific energy.**

Hence Fuel with high energy density and specific energy play an important role in development. 

## Sankey diagam
>**Sankey diagrams** are a type of [flow diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_diagram "Flow diagram") in which the width of the arrows is proportional to the flow rate of the depicted [extensive property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_and_extensive_properties "Intensive and extensive properties").

## Electrical Energy
>**Electrical energy** is [energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy "Energy") related to forces on [electrically-charged particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charged_particle "Charged particle") and the movement of those particles (often [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrons "Electrons") in wires, but not always).

Electrical energy is produced by Generator. Refer to faraday's law of induction which talk about in [[Mainfolder/Physics/Physics Review/Topics/Electromagnetic induction (HL)\|Electromagnetic induction (HL)]] 

### Production of electrical power:

1. Fuel is used to boil water to produce pressurized steam.
2. The pressurized steam drives a turbine which is connected to coils of wire.
3. When the turbine rotates, the coils of wire move through a strong magnetic field. Electrical power is produced via electromagnetic induction in the generato

#### Nuclear Power station

- In order to gain $\ce{U^235}$ we need to **enrichment** the Uranium
	- One way to enrichment is gaseous diffusion
	- Another wat is centrifuging

>The Chain rule of $\ce{U}-235$ :

- In order to control the rate of reaction we need **control rod** to absorb the neutron

- In order to create the chain reaction, we need to slow down the neutron, we need Moderator (graphite) to reduce the speed the neutron.

### Wind generator
>A **wind turbine** is a device that [converts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power "Wind power") the [kinetic energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy "Kinetic energy") of [wind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind "Wind") into [electrical energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_energy "Electrical energy").

The Mechanism of Wind turbine to generate electricity is very complex, ![How do wind turbines produce electricity? | HopgoodGanim Lawyers](https://www.hopgoodganim.com.au/content/Document/Article%20images/Resources%20%26%20Energy/wind%20turbine.png)
The speed draft will control the speed of blades rotate, we assume that the speed is constant, then the energy of wind is:
$$P=\frac{1}{2}\rho A v^3$$
where $\rho$ is density of air, $A=\pi r^2$ is the area of the blades, $v$ is the speed of wind.
*The condition for using this equation: **The air will completely stop after cross this wind turbine.** which is impossible.* 
Therefore we have another formula:$$P_{output}=\eta(P_{in}-P_{out})$$
where $\rho_i<\rho_o$ and $v_{in}>v_{out}$ , $\eta$ is the efficiency 

### Sun & Moon derived energy
>**Hydroelectricity**, or **hydroelectric power**, is [electricity generated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation "Electricity generation") from [hydropower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydropower "Hydropower") (water power).

#### Solar Energy
Solar panel $\to$ Solar $\to$ Heat
Photovoltaic cells $\to$ Solar $\to$ Electricity

$$\text{Intensity光强}=\frac{Power}{Area}$$
>Solar constant measures the amount of energy received by a given area one astronomical unit away from the Sun$$I= \frac{P}{A}=1380wm^{-2}$$

*The intensity is different for different parts of the earth because the shape of earth is ball and more close to the equatorial the high intensity.*
