## Newton's law of motion

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Newton's 1st Law</mark>
>An object continues to remain stationary or to move at a constant velocity unless an external force acts on it.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Newton's 2nd Law</mark>
$$F=ma$$
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Newtonâ€™s third law</mark> 
>Every action has an equal and opposite reaction.
*(The law can be expressed in a number of equivalent ways)*

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Terminal speed:</mark>
At this point there is no longer any acceleration and the diver has reached a constant rate of fall known as the terminal speed.
