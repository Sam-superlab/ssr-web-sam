>We call the product of the mass $m$ of an object and its instantaneous velocity $v$ the momentum $p$ of the object:
$$p=mv$$

It is related to 2nd law of Newton in [[Mainfolder/Physics/Physics Review/Topics/Force\|Force]]. It can be explained as$$F= \frac{dp}{dt}=ma$$
- <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">If velocity or mass is changing then the momentum must also be changing. </mark>We shall be looking at the two cases where one quantity changes while the other is held constant.
- When a net resultant force acts on an object, the object accelerates and the velocity must change.

>Momentum is always constant if no external force acts on the system.

*This is known as the principle of conservation of linear momentum, the word “linear” is here because this is momentum when the objects concerned are moving in straight lines. Hence for circular motion it will have another invariant, see [[Mainfolder/Physics/Physics Review/Topics/Circular motion and gravitation\|Circular motion and gravitation]] * 

### Elastic collision
>No permanent deformation must occur in the colliding objects and no energy can be released as internal energy (through friction), sound, or any other way.

*With Both Energy and momentum conservation*
### Inelastic collision
>When a moving object collides with a stationary one and the two objects stick together, then some of the initial kinetic energy is lost. After the collision, there is a single object with an increased (combined) mass and a single common velocity.

*With Energy loss but momentum conservation*

## Energy and momentum
For Kinetic energy in [[Mainfolder/Physics/Physics Review/Topics/Work, Energy\|Work, Energy]] we have another way to calculate:
$$E_{K}= \frac{p^2}{2m}$$
## Impulse
We already know that:
$$F= \frac{dp}{dt}$$
Hence:
$$F\times dt= dp$$
where $Force\times time=change\ in\ momentum$ 

>The product of force and time is given the name impulse
