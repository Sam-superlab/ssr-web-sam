## Introduction
>**Temperature** is a measure of the average kinetic energy of particles.

>**Heat** is a form of energy that flows from something at a higher temperature to something at a lower temperature.

## Absolute temperature
>The absolute temperature scale is the standard SI temperature scale with its unit the kelvin ($K$) being one of the seven SI base units. 

*Absolute temperature is defined to be zero kelvin at absolute zero (the temperature at which all matter has minimum kinetic energy) and 273.16 K at the triple point of water (the unique temperature and pressure at which water can exist as liquid water, ice, and water vapour).* 

$$T(K)=\theta(^{\circ}C)+273$$
## Internal energy
> The internal energy of a substance is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">total of the potential energy and the random kinetic energy of all the particles</mark> in the substance.

## Specific heat capacity
>The specific heat capacity ($c$) of a substance as the energy transferred to 1 $kg$ of the substance causing its temperature to increase by 1 $K$.

$$Q=cm\Delta T$$
## Specific latent heat
>The energy required to achieve the change of phase is called latent heat

$$L=\frac{Q}{m}$$
