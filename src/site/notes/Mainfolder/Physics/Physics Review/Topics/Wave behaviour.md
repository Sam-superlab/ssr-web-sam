## Snell’s law
>For waves of a particular frequency and for a chosen pair of media the ratio of the sine of the angle of incidence to the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant called the (relative) refractive index.
>$$\frac{sin\theta_{1}}{sin\theta_{2}}= \frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}$$
*The index of air is 1*

## Refractive index and Snell’s law
>The **absolute refractive index ($n$)** of a medium is defined in terms of the speed of electromagnetic waves as:
>$$n=\frac{\text{speed of electromagnetic waves in vacuum}}{\text{speed of electromagnetic waves in the medium}}= \frac{c}{v}$$

## The critical angle and total internal reflection
>**Optical density** is not the same as physical density, i.e. mass per unit volume, it is measured in terms of refractive index – higher refractive index material having higher optical density.


- Example of total internal reflection

		- The angle of incidence at this value is called the **critical angle** ($\theta_c$). Ray 5 shows that, when the angle of incidence is larger than the critical angle, the light wave does not move into the new medium at all but is reflected back into the original medium. This process is called **total internal reflection.**

### Calculating the critical angle
Using equation:
$$\sin\theta_{c}= \frac{1}{n_{1}}$$

## Diffraction

- Further observation of diffraction has shown:
	- the frequency, wavelength, and speed of the waves each remains the same after diffraction
	- the direction of propagation and the pattern of the waves change
	- the effect of diffraction is most obvious when the **aperture width is approximately equal to the wavelength of the waves**.
	- the amplitude of the diffracted wave is less than that of the incident wave because the energy is distributed over a larger area.

## Interference
> **interference** is a phenomenon in which two [coherent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coherence_(physics) "Coherence (physics)") [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave "Wave") are combined by adding their intensities or displacements with due consideration for their _[phase difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_difference "Phase difference")_.(From wikipedia)

More commonly:
*When two or more waves meet they combine to produce a new wave* 

- Two situations of interference
	- The amplitude increase: constructive
	- The amplitude decrease: destructive

>**Coherent** is sources have the same frequency.

This is an example for interference of light waves

## Path difference and the double-slit equation
The proof see:
[[Mainfolder/Physics/Physics Review/Concepts/Proof of double-slit equation\|Proof of double-slit equation]] 

The double-slit equation
$$s= \frac{\lambda D}{d}$$

Where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are two resources of wave.

- constructive and destructive $n=1,2,3,...$ 
	- constructive interference the path difference must=$n\lambda$ 
	- destructive interference the path difference must = $(n+\frac{1}{2})\lambda$
