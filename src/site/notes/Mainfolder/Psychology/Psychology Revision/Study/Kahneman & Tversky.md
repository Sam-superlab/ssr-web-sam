## Aim
to investigate the effect of availability [[Mainfolder/Psychology/Psychology Revision/Concepts/Heuristics\|Heuristics]] on system one processing (quick mathematical estimations)

## Procedure 
Two groups of high school students: estimated the result of multiplication with numbers in either ascending (1x2x3x4...)or descending (9x8x7x6...) order

## Results
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Mean estimated result was greater for the group with numbers in descending order (9x8x7...) than for the ascending condition</mark>

## Conclusion
System one processing is prone to anchoring bias, as the first piece of information we receive affects our cognition.

## Limitations
Mundane realism: not a task occurring often IRL, <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">did not control for mathematical skills</mark>, which can affect the accuracy of estimated product
