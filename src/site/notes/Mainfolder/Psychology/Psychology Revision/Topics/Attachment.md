### Theory of Attachment
>**[[Mainfolder/Psychology/Psychology Revision/Topics/Bowlby's Internal Working Model of Attachment\|Bowlby's Internal Working Model of Attachment]]** is a psychological approach that attempts to describe the development of mental representations, specifically the worthiness of the self and expectations of others' reactions to the self.

1. **Ideas about Attachment Figures**: Children develop expectations about their primary caregivers based on their early interactions. If they consistently receive love, care, and support, they are likely to develop positive expectations about others in their future relationships. Conversely, if they experience inconsistent or neglectful caregiving, they may develop negative expectations or mistrust in their relationships.
2. **Ideas about the Self**: Children also form beliefs about themselves based on their interactions with caregivers. If they consistently receive love and attention, they are more likely to develop a positive self-concept, seeing themselves as worthy of love and care. On the other hand, if they experience rejection or neglect, they may develop negative self-concepts and feelings of unworthiness.
3. **Ideas about How the Self and Others Relate**: The Internal Working Model includes the child's understanding of how relationships work. This includes how one should behave in relationships, what to expect from others, and how conflicts should be resolved. Children who have had secure attachments tend to develop healthy relationship patterns, while those with insecure attachments may struggle with intimacy, trust, and conflict resolution.
4. **Issue of IWM**: It's important to note that these internal working models are not set in stone but can evolve over time. Positive experiences in later relationships or therapeutic interventions can help individuals reshape their working models and improve their mental health and the quality of their relationships.

*An internal working model is essentially a description of how people feel about themselves.*
