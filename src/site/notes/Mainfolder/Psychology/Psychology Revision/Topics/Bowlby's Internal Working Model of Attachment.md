John Bowlby was a British psychoanalyst who developed the **evolutionary theory of attachment**. [According to Bowlby, children are born with an innate need to form attachments with others, which helps them survive](https://www.simplypsychology.org/bowlby.html). He believed that a child forms many attachments, but one of these is qualitatively different. [This is what he called primary attachment, monotropy](https://www.simplypsychology.org/bowlby.html). Bowlby hypothesized that there is a critical period for developing attachment, which is around 2.5 years. [If an attachment has not developed during this time period, then it may well not happen at all](https://www.simplypsychology.org/bowlby.html). [Bowlby also proposed a sensitive period of up to 5 years](https://www.simplypsychology.org/bowlby.html).

[Bowlby’s maternal deprivation hypothesis suggests that continual attachment disruption between the infant and primary caregiver could result in long-term cognitive, social, and emotional difficulties for that infant](https://www.simplypsychology.org/bowlby.html). According to Bowlby, an internal working model is a cognitive framework comprising mental representations for understanding the world, self, and others, and is based on the relationship with a primary caregiver. [It becomes a prototype for all future social relationships and allows individuals to predict, control, and manipulate interactions with others](https://www.simplypsychology.org/bowlby.html).

[Bowlby’s theory has been influential in shaping our understanding of early childhood development and has been applied in various fields such as psychology, education, and social work](https://www.simplypsychology.org/bowlby.html).
