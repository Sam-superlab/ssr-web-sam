### Culture and Cognition in IBDP Psychology

1. **Influence of Culture on Cognitive Processes**:
    - Culture significantly impacts our behavior, attitudes, and cognitive processes.
    - It plays a role in the creation of schemas, which in turn affect memory and how information is remembered.
2. **Study of Memory and Culture**:
    - The chapter on Culture and Cognition delves into how culture affects the cognitive process of memory.
    - An example is the study by Bartlett
3. **Role of Schemas**:
    - Schemas, which are influenced by cultural norms and values, play a crucial role in how information is processed and recalled.
    - Cultural differences can lead to variations in how people remember and perform tasks that are culturally relevant or familiar to them.
