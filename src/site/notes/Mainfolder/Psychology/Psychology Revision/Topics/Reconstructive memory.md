## Definitions
[Reconstructive memory is the **process of recalling an event or a story by using partial information and schemas**](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=28ef8fff8133b2daJmltdHM9MTY5NDgyMjQwMCZpZ3VpZD0wNzRiMmFjNS0wN2VkLTZlYzgtMTRiZS0zOTQ3MDZlNTZmZGEmaW5zaWQ9NTk5OQ&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=074b2ac5-07ed-6ec8-14be-394706e56fda&psq=Reconstructive+memory&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9wcmFjdGljYWxwaWUuY29tL3JlY29uc3RydWN0aXZlLW1lbW9yeS8&ntb=1). [Schemas are **our previous knowledge and experience of a situation**](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=f71a79bbe094e9c4JmltdHM9MTY5NDgyMjQwMCZpZ3VpZD0wNzRiMmFjNS0wN2VkLTZlYzgtMTRiZS0zOTQ3MDZlNTZmZGEmaW5zaWQ9NjAwMw&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=074b2ac5-07ed-6ec8-14be-394706e56fda&psq=Reconstructive+memory&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9wcmFjdGljYWxwaWUuY29tL3JlY29uc3RydWN0aXZlLW1lbW9yeS8&ntb=1). [We use reconstructive memory to **fill in the gaps and make sense of what happened**](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=209745457a7b59c2JmltdHM9MTY5NDgyMjQwMCZpZ3VpZD0wNzRiMmFjNS0wN2VkLTZlYzgtMTRiZS0zOTQ3MDZlNTZmZGEmaW5zaWQ9NjAwNg&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=074b2ac5-07ed-6ec8-14be-394706e56fda&psq=Reconstructive+memory&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9wcmFjdGljYWxwaWUuY29tL3JlY29uc3RydWN0aXZlLW1lbW9yeS8&ntb=1). Psychologist Frederic Bartlett discovered reconstructive memory 

Reconstructive memory is a theory of elaborate memory recall proposed by Frederic Bartlett in 1932. This theory posits that memory is not a passive retrieval process but rather an active process of reconstruction. Here are some key points about reconstructive memory:

1. **Active Reconstruction**: According to this theory, memories are not stored as discrete, unchanging entities but are actively reconstructed each time they are recalled. This reconstruction process is influenced by various factors including the individual's beliefs, expectations, and environment.
    
2. **Schemas**: Bartlett introduced the concept of "schemas" in memory theory. Schemas are mental frameworks that help organize and interpret information. They play a significant role in how memories are reconstructed. Memories are encoded and stored in the brain with pre-existing schemas and are reconstructed during recall according to these schemas.
    
3. **Distortion of Memories**: Reconstructive memory theory suggests that memories can be distorted over time. Each time a memory is recalled and reconstructed, it may be altered slightly, leading to inaccuracies or distortions. This can be due to the influence of current knowledge, beliefs, or the context in which the recall occurs.
    
4. **War of the Ghosts Experiment**: Bartlett's famous experiment, "War of the Ghosts," demonstrated reconstructive memory. He asked participants to remember a story from a different culture and observed how they reconstructed the story over time. The retellings showed significant alterations influenced by the participants' cultural backgrounds and personal biases.
    
5. **Implications**: This theory has significant implications in various fields, including psychology, law, and cognitive science. It challenges the idea of memory as a reliable source and highlights the potential for false memories and the unreliability of eyewitness testimony.
    
6. **Criticism and Further Research**: While influential, Bartlett's theory has been criticized for its lack of empirical evidence and methodological rigor. However, it has paved the way for further research into memory, cognition, and the reliability of eyewitness testimony.
    

Reconstructive memory theory fundamentally changed the understanding of memory, emphasizing its dynamic and constructive nature. It highlights how our memories are not static snapshots of events but are subject to change and interpretation over time.
## Main Argument 
Questions that are suggestive in some way - and post-event information facilitate schema processing which may influence the accuracy of recall. This is called the **misinformation effect**. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Bartlett argues that when we create these memories, we often make assumptions about what could or should have happened.</mark>

## Issue
**Yuille and Cutshall** (1986)found that eyewitnesses were very reliable. They recalled a large amount of accurate detail that could be confirmed by the original police reports.
