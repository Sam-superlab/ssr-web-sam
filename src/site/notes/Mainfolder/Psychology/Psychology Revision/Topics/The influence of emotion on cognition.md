## Definitions
[According to the American Psychological Association (APA), emotion is defined as “a complex reaction pattern, involving experiential, behavioral and physiological elements”](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=500b870b24a67a94JmltdHM9MTY5NDkwODgwMCZpZ3VpZD0wNzRiMmFjNS0wN2VkLTZlYzgtMTRiZS0zOTQ3MDZlNTZmZGEmaW5zaWQ9NTg3Nw&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=074b2ac5-07ed-6ec8-14be-394706e56fda&psq=emotion+definition+in+psychology&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9vbmxpbmUudXdhLmVkdS9uZXdzL2Vtb3Rpb25hbC1wc3ljaG9sb2d5Lw&ntb=1).
## Flashbulb memory model
Flashbulb memory theory refers to the phenomenon where individuals have **exceptionally clear memories of emotionally significant events**. These memories are often described as vivid and detailed, much like a photograph. [They are typically associated with surprising, consequential, and emotionally arousing events, such as hearing about a national tragedy or experiencing a personal milestone](https://www.simplypsychology.org/flashbulb-memory.html). 闪光灯记忆理论是指个体对情感重要事件有异常清晰的记忆的现象。这些记忆通常被描述为生动而详细，就像照片一样。它们通常与令人惊讶、后果深刻和情绪激动的事件有关，例如听到国家悲剧或经历个人里程碑.

It is believed that flashbulb memories are affected by our emotional state. [The analogy of a flashbulb describes how we can often remember where we were, what we were doing, how we were informed, and how we reacted as if the whole scene had been “illuminated” by a flashbulb](https://www.simplypsychology.org/flashbulb-memory.html). 人们相信闪光灯记忆会受到我们情绪状态的影响。闪光灯的类比描述了我们如何经常记住我们在哪里，我们在做什么，我们如何被告知，以及我们如何反应，就好像整个场景都被闪光灯“照亮”了一样。

## Issue. 
Whether the emotion is universal 
## Evaluation
**Limitations**

- Neisser argues that it is one's level of confidence, not accuracy, that defines FBM.
- Several constructs in the study of FBM are problematic - level of personal relevance, level of surprise, amount of overt rehearsal
- There are cultural differences that indicate that rehearsal may play the most important role in the development of FBM.
- Often with real-life research on the topic, it is impossible to verify the accuracy of memories.
- It is not possible to measure one's emotional state at the time of an event - thus making it impossible to demonstrate a clear causal explanation.

## Hypothesis
The **somatic marker hypothesis** suggests that good decision-making depends on an ability to access appropriate emotional information linked to the situation in which the decision is being made.

## Issue
This hypothesis does not have situations which decisions made during periods of intense emotion not connected to the decision itself
