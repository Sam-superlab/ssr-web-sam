## Introduction
>**Theory of mind** argued that the cognitive ability to attribute mental states(Intention, perspectives, beliefs) to others

Factors including drug and alcohol consumption, language development, cognitive delays, age, and culture can affect a person's capacity to display theory of mind. Having a theory of mind is similar to but not identical with having the capacity for [empathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy "Empathy") or [sympathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathy "Sympathy").

## Stages of theory of mind
- The **"pre-theory of mind" stage** is the first year of a child's life
- **The desire stage of theory of mind** is the ability to detect that someone wants something or wants something to happen.
- The **belief-desire stage of theory of mind**, which begins around three years of age, is when children are able to make mental representations of the world.
- The final stage, the **representational stage of theory of mind**, begins at around four years of age.
- 
## Issue
- When do we develop our theory of mind -- start from 18 month of children to 4 years old.
- To what extend, we can understand others by theory of mind 
- Does animals have theory of mind
- Cultural factor of theory of mind
