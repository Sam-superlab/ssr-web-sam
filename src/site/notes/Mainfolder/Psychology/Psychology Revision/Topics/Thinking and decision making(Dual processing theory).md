#con 
**[[Mainfolder/Psychology/Psychology Revision/Concepts/Thinking\|Thinking]]** is the process of using knowledge and information to make plans, interpret the world, and make predictions about the world in which we live in.
  
**[[Mainfolder/Psychology/Psychology Revision/Concepts/Decision making\|Decision making]]** 

## Dual processing theory
**The Dual Process Model** of thinking and decision-making postulates that there are two basic modes of thinking.
### [[Mainfolder/Psychology/Psychology Revision/Concepts/System 1\|System 1]]
System 1 thinking often employs **[[Mainfolder/Psychology/Psychology Revision/Concepts/Heuristics\|Heuristics]]** - that is, a ‘rule’ used to make decisions or form judgments.
### [[Mainfolder/Psychology/Psychology Revision/Concepts/System 2\|System 2]]
This mode of thinking is assumed to require more effort. System 2  starts by thinking carefully about all of the possible ways we could interpret a situation and gradually eliminates possibilities based on sensory evidence until we arrive at a solution.

| System 1    | System 2 |
| -------- | ------- |
| Context-dependent - focuses on existing evidence and ignores absent evidence  | Abstract    |
| Concerns about everyday decision making | Conscious reasoning     |
| Generates impressions and inclinations.    | Logical and reliable    |

## Evaluation of the theory

### Strengths
There is biological evidence that different types of thinking may be processed in different parts of the brain.
The Wason selection task and other tests for cognitive biases (see the next part of this chapter) are reliable in their results.

### Limitations
The model can seem to be overly reductionist as it does not clearly explain how (or even if) these modes of thinking interact or how our thinking and decision-making could be influenced by emotion.
The definitions of System 1 and System 2 are not always clear.  
For example, fast processing indicates the use of System 1 rather than System 2 processes. However, just because processing is fast does not mean it is done by System 1. Experience can influence System 2 processing to go faster.
