## About Me

Hello! I'm Sam Ren, a high school student at China World Academy. I hope you will know me better through this personal website :) Here is the link to Sam's Superlab project: [[Mainfolder/Sam's Superlab\|Sam's Superlab]] 

## Research Experience
I have done serval research during high school, here is the link
[[Mainfolder/Sam Ren/Research Experience\|Research Experience]] 
Overall, I am dealing with diverse areas in math, including group theory, number theory, cryptography, Quaternions, Riemann surface, philosophy of math, etc.

## My interests
### Basketball
I have played Basketball for about 12 years and I am now the captain and the coach of my school basketball team. I delve into basketball because it is fantastic when the ball just goes into the basket. This is the link to the basketball team: [[Mainfolder/Sam Ren/Basketball Team\|Basketball Team]] 

### Workouts
I started workouts for about 1 year, and when I was in grade 9, I was about 220 pounds and for now I have already lost 50 pounds of weight. The reason why I lost weight is mainly because my dad was sick and obese during COVID-19 isolation. I wanted to help him and engage him so we just losing weight together. Later, instead of becoming a person who only works out for health, I am a bit beyond that. I look forward to doing some natural physique competition.
