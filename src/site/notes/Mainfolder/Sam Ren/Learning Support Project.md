In this project, we aimed to express our ideas and beliefs beyond our campus walls by conducting physical and chemical experiments and teaching at nearby schools. By giving these young learners experiences they never had, I hoped to ignite their enthusiasm for STEM subjects, give back to the community, and help raise the next generation of scientists.
