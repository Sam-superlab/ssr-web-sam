## Introduction to Bootstrapping

Bootstrapping is a distribution-free approach that serves as an alternative to normal and t-distribution methods for statistical inference. According to your materials, bootstrapping addresses a core challenge:

## Fundamental Concept

Bootstrapping uses the original sample as a population proxy to create multiple resamples. The key process involves:

1. Taking the original sample
2. Creating bootstrap samples through sampling with replacement
3. Maintaining the original sample size in each resample
4. Building a bootstrap distribution from the resampled statistics

## Advantages of Bootstrapping

Your knowledge base highlights several key advantages:

1. Distribution-free approach (no normality assumption required)
2. Adaptable to various statistics beyond means and proportions:
   - Medians
   - Standard deviations
   - IQR
3. Requires minimal theoretical assumptions

## Implementation Process

The practical steps include:

1. Create multiple bootstrap samples (typically ≥1,000 resamples)
2. Calculate the statistic of interest for each resample
3. Aggregate results into a distribution plot
4. Observe the emergent distribution shape (often normal-like)
5. Identify the central peak around the original sample mean

## Confidence Interval Derivation

The percentile method is commonly used:

- For a 95% CI:
  - Lower bound: 2.5th percentile of bootstrap distribution
  - Upper bound: 97.5th percentile of bootstrap distribution

Generalization Formula:
- (α/2 × 100)th to (1 − α/2 × 100)th percentiles

Example confidence levels:
- 90% CI: 5th to 95th percentiles
- 99% CI: 0.5th to 99.5th percentiles

## Critical Implementation Requirements

Your knowledge base emphasizes several requirements:

1. Data Requirements:
   - Original sample must be randomly selected
   - Sufficiently large (n ≥ 30 recommended)

2. Resampling Protocol:
   - Strict replacement policy
   - Identical sample size maintenance

3. Error Prevention - Avoid:
   - Sampling without replacement
   - Altering sample sizes
   - Modifying original data values

## Comparison to Traditional Methods

| Method          | Theoretical Basis | Data Requirements | Computational Load |
|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Traditional CI  | CLT/Normal Theory | Large n           | Low                |
| Bootstrap CI    | Empirical Resampling | Moderate n      | High               |

## R Implementation Example

```R
bootstrap <- function(x, statistic, n = 1000L) {
 bs <- replicate(n, {
    sb <- sample(x, replace = TRUE)
    statistic(sb)
  })
  data.frame(Sample = seq_len(n), Statistic = bs)
}
```

This function demonstrates the core bootstrapping process:
1. Take `n` resamples with replacement
2. Apply the desired statistic to each resample
3. Return the results as a data frame

## Validation Process

To ensure valid bootstrap results:

1. Verify bootstrap distribution shape
2. Check symmetry properties:
   - If symmetric → standard error methods may be applicable
   - If asymmetric → percentile method preferred
