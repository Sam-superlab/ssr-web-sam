## What is center?
>The **center** of a **quantitative variable** is meant to help us answer What are the *most common values*? Where does the data bunch up? What is the ’typical’ value that most observations had?

## Methodology
Center: typically we use [[Mainfolder/Statistics/mean\|mean]]s or [[Mainfolder/Statistics/median\|median]]s
