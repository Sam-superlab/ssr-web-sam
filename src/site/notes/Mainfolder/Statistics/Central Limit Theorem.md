>The sum of many **independent random variables** will approximately follow a Normal distribution

### Key Points of the CLT
- If a variable X has mean μ and standard deviation σ
- And if the sample size (n) is large
- Then the [[Mainfolder/Statistics/sampling distribution\|sampling distribution]] for $\bar{x}$(sample mean) is approximately Normal with:
  - Mean = $\mu$
  - [[Mainfolder/Statistics/Standard error\|Standard error]] = $\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
- Expressed as $\bar{x} \sim N(\mu, \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}})$

### Importance of CLT
- Natural phenomena: Many natural phenomena result from many independent random events, leading to Normal distributions
- Statistical inference: Allows us to make inferences about population parameters using sample statistics
