# Constructing Confidence Intervals for Proportions

Based on your personal knowledge base from Grinnell College Introduction to Statistics, when asked to construct a confidence interval for a proportion, you should follow these steps:

## For a Single Population Proportion:

1. Identify the parameter of interest: 
   - The population proportion p that you're trying to estimate

2. Check the required conditions:
   - Random sample (state whether met or not met)
   - Success condition: n × p̂ ≥ 10 (state whether met or not met)
   - Failure condition: n × (1 − p̂) ≥ 10 (state whether met or not met)

3. Calculate the sample proportion:
   - p̂ = number of successes / sample size

4. Calculate the standard error:
   - SE = √(p̂(1 − p̂)/n)

5. Determine the appropriate z* value based on confidence level:
   - 95% Confidence → z* = 1.96
   - 90% Confidence → z* = 1.645
   - 80% Confidence → z* = 1.282
   - 99% Confidence → z* = 2.576

6. Calculate the confidence interval:
   - p̂ ± z* × SE

7. Interpret the result:
   - "We are [confidence level]% confident that the true population proportion is between [lower bound] and [upper bound]."

## For Difference in Population Proportions:

1. Check conditions:
   - Random samples for both groups
   - Both groups are independent 
   - Success and failure conditions for both groups

2. Calculate the formula:
   - (p̂₁ − p̂₂) ± z* × √(p̂₁(1 − p̂₁)/n₁ + p̂₂(1 − p̂₂)/n₂)

3. Interpret carefully, noting:
   - A positive interval indicates p₁ is likely larger than p₂
   - A negative interval indicates p₁ is likely smaller than p₂
   - If interval contains zero, there may be no significant difference
