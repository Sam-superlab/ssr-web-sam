## Defintion of Expectation
>**Expected Value**($E(X)$) to denote that this is an average(or [[Mainfolder/Statistics/mean\|mean]]) for a random variable$$E(X)=x_{i} p_{i}$$
>Whera $x_i$ is value of outcome $i$ and $p_{i}$ is the probability of outcome $i$ 

## Calculation rules
- $E(X+Y)=E(X)+E(Y)$


## Definition of Variance

>Like what it called, **variance($Var(X)$)** measures the variability during the process and in probability with formula$$Var(X)=E[(X-\mu)^{2}]= E(X^{2})-\mu^{2}=\sum (x_i)^2p_{i}-\mu^2$$

## Calculation rules
We need to assume X and Y are independent of each other
- Addition : $Var(X+Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y)$
- Substract: $Var(X-Y)=Var(X)+Var(Y)$
- scalar multiplcation $Var(cX)=c^{2}Var(X)$
