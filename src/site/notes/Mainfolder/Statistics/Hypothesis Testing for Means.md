# Hypothesis Tests for Means

## Purpose and Rationale

### Why Test Means?
Testing means serves several crucial purposes in statistical analysis:

1. **Comparing to Standards**
   * Evaluate if a process meets specifications
   * Check if performance matches targets
   * Verify if measurements align with expected values

2. **Comparing Groups**
   * Assess treatment effectiveness
   * Compare different methods or approaches
   * Evaluate before/after changes

3. **Making Decisions**
   * Determine if changes are needed
   * Guide process improvements
   * Inform policy decisions

### The Rationale Behind Mean Tests

1. **Why Means Matter**
   * Means are fundamental measures of central tendency
   * They're sensitive to changes in the population
   * They're mathematically tractable and well-understood
   * They form the basis for many other statistical methods

2. **Why Different Tests Exist**
   * Population standard deviation known vs unknown
   * Sample size considerations
   * Single group vs multiple groups
   * Independent vs dependent samples

3. **Why Conditions Matter**
   * Ensures valid statistical inference
   * Protects against incorrect conclusions
   * Maintains the integrity of the testing process
   * Enables proper interpretation of results

## Test Selection Guide

| Test Type | When to Use | Key Assumptions | Example |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| Single Mean z-test | Known $\sigma$, $n \geq 30$ | Normal or large sample | Testing if mean height = 170cm |
| Single Mean t-test | Unknown $\sigma$ | Normal or large sample | Testing if mean score > 75 |
| Two Mean z-test | Known $\sigma$s | Independent samples | Comparing two production lines |
| Two Mean t-test | Unknown $\sigma$s | Independent samples | Comparing treatment groups |

## Single Mean Test

### Hypotheses Structure

| Type | Symbolic Form | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Null | $H_0: \mu = \mu_0$ | $H_0: \mu = 100$ |
| Right-tailed | $H_a: \mu > \mu_0$ | $H_a: \mu > 100$ |
| Left-tailed | $H_a: \mu < \mu_0$ | $H_a: \mu < 100$ |
| Two-tailed | $H_a: \mu \neq \mu_0$ | $H_a: \mu \neq 100$ |

### Test Statistics

| Scenario | Test Statistic | Distribution | Degrees of Freedom |
|----------|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Known $\sigma$ | $Z = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}$ | $Z \sim N(0,1)$ | N/A |
| Unknown $\sigma$ | $T = \frac{\bar{x} - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$ | $T \sim t(df = n-1)$ | $n-1$ |

### Conditions and Verification

| Condition | How to Check | Common Issues |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| Random Sample | Study design | Selection bias |
| Independence | Context | Time series data |
| Normality | Plot data or $n \geq 30$ | Skewness, outliers |

### P-value Calculations

| Alternative  | Formula          | Rejection Region |     |         |     |            |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ---------------- | --- | ------- | --- | ---------- |
| Right-tailed | $P(Z > z_{obs})$ | Upper tail       |     |         |     |            |
| Left-tailed  | $P(Z < z_{obs})$ | Lower tail       |     |         |     |            |
| Two-tailed   | $2 \times P(     | Z                | >   | z_{obs} | )$  | Both tails |

## Difference of Means Test

### Hypotheses Structure

| Type        | Symbolic Form                      | Verbal Description          |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Null        | $H_0: \mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$           | No difference between means |
| Alternative | $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2$ [<, >, â‰ ] $0$ | Difference exists           |

### Test Statistics

| Scenario | Formula | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Known $\sigma$s | $Z = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}}$ | Rarely used |
| Unknown $\sigma$s | $T = \frac{(\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2)}{\sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}}$ | Most common |

### Degrees of Freedom Options

| Method | Formula | When to Use |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Conservative | $df = \min(n_1-1, n_2-1)$ | Quick approximation |
| Welch's | Complex formula | More accurate |

### Common Applications

| Application | Example | Key Considerations |
|-------------|---------|-------------------|
| Treatment Effects | Drug vs Placebo | Randomization |
| Before/After | Training Program | Paired data option |
| Group Comparisons | Method A vs B | Independence |

## Best Practices

### Reporting Checklist

| Component | What to Include | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Context | Research question | "Testing if new method improves scores" |
| Conditions | Verification of assumptions | "Data normally distributed (p > 0.05)" |
| Test Details | Statistic, df, p-value | "t(28) = 2.45, p = 0.021" |
| Conclusion | Interpretation | "Evidence suggests improvement (d = 0.6)" |

### Interpretation Guidelines

| Result | Statistical Conclusion | Practical Interpretation |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Small p-value | Reject $H_0$ | Evidence of effect |
| Large p-value | Fail to reject $H_0$ | Insufficient evidence |
| Effect size | Magnitude of difference | Practical importance |
