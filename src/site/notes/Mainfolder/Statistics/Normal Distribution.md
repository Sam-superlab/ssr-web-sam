## What is normal distribution

Due to [[Mainfolder/Statistics/Central Limit Theorem\|Central Limit Theorem]] we have seen normal distribution really often. 
The Normal distribution is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics, appearing frequently in nature and statistical theory.

### Key Properties of Normal Distribution
- **Definition**: A bell-shaped, unimodal, and symmetric distribution
- **Parameters**: Characterized by two parameters:
  - Mean ($\mu$): The center of the distribution
  - Standard Deviation ($\sigma$) or Variance($\sigma^{2}$): The spread of the distribution
- Notation: If a variable follows a Normal distribution, it's denoted as X~ N($\mu$, $\sigma^{2}$)

### Standard Normal Distribution
The Standard Normal Distribution is a special case with:
- Mean = 0
- Variance = 1
- Denoted as X ∼ N(0, 1)

### Standardizing Normal Variables
From your knowledge base:
- If X ∼ N($\mu, \sigma^{2}$), then Y = (X - μ)/σ ∼ N(0, 1)
- This process is called standardizing a Normal variable
- The resulting value is known as a z-score

### Important Probabilities
For a Standard Normal Distribution:
- P(|X| < 1) = 0.68286 (68% of values within 1 standard deviation)
- P(|X| < 2) = 0.9545 (95% of values within 2 standard deviations)
- P(|X| < 3) = 0.9973 (99.7% of values within 3 standard deviations)
- Also known as 68-96-99.7 Rule:![Screenshot 2025-04-06 at 12.23.40 PM.png](/img/user/%E9%99%84%E4%BB%B6/Screenshot%202025-04-06%20at%2012.23.40%20PM.png)
