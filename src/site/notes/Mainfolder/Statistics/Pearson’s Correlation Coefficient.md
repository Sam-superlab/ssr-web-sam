## What is Pearson’s Correlation Coefficient
Building upon the work from French scientist Francis Galton, Pearson developed the **Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r)**:
$$r= \frac{1}{n-1} \sum(z_{x_{i}})(z{y_{i}})$$ Pearson’s correlation coefficient tells us the strength of linear association between two quantitative variables (and direction!)

**Notice that it can only indicates linear relationship, its possible that exists other relationship with r very small**

- If $r>0$ then the correlation is positive
- If $r<0$ then the correlation is negative

If $r$ is around 0.5 then we would say it is moderate.
If $r$ is less than 0.3 then we would say it is weak
If $r$ is greater than 0.7 then we say it is strong

## Properties
-  r has no units 
-  r measures the strength of a linear relationship 
-  r is between -1 and 1 
-  The closer r is to 0 -> weaker relationship 
-  The further r is from 0 -> stronger relationship 
-  r=0 -> no linear relationship 
-  changing scale of either variable doesn’t affect r value
