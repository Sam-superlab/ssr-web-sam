# Power Analysis

## Purpose and Rationale

### Why Power Analysis Matters
Power analysis is crucial because:

1. **Study Design**
   * Helps determine appropriate sample size
   * Ensures studies can detect meaningful effects
   * Prevents wasted resources on underpowered studies

2. **Resource Management**
   * Optimizes use of time and money
   * Prevents over- or under-sampling
   * Helps plan research budgets

3. **Research Quality**
   * Increases reliability of findings
   * Reduces risk of Type II errors
   * Improves study credibility

### The Rationale Behind Power Analysis

1. **Why We Need It**
   * Studies need sufficient power to detect effects
   * Resources are often limited
   * Need to balance practical constraints with statistical requirements

2. **How It Works**
   * Calculates probability of detecting effects
   * Considers multiple factors affecting power
   * Helps make informed decisions about study design

## Understanding Power

### Core Concepts

| Concept | Description | Importance |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| Power | Probability of rejecting false $H_0$ | Measures test sensitivity |
| Effect Size | Magnitude of expected effect | Influences required sample size |
| Sample Size | Number of observations | Major determinant of power |
| Significance Level | Type I error rate ($\alpha$) | Affects power calculation |

### Factors Affecting Power

| Factor | Effect on Power | How to Control |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Sample Size | Larger $n$ = higher power | Plan adequate sample size |
| Effect Size | Larger effect = higher power | Consider meaningful effects |
| Significance Level | Lower $\alpha$ = lower power | Choose appropriate $\alpha$ |
| Variability | Less variability = higher power | Improve measurement precision |

## Power Analysis Process

### Planning Phase

1. **Determine Parameters**
   * Expected effect size
   * Desired power level
   * Significance level
   * Available resources

2. **Consider Constraints**
   * Time limitations
   * Budget constraints
   * Practical limitations
   * Ethical considerations

### Calculation Methods

| Method | When to Use | Advantages |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| A priori | Before study | Optimal planning |
| Post hoc | After study | Evaluate completed study |
| Compromise | During study | Adjust if needed |

## Practical Applications

### Sample Size Determination

| Approach | Description | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Fixed sample size | Determine n for desired power | Most common |
| Sequential analysis | Adjust n based on interim results | When flexible |
| Adaptive design | Modify based on early data | Complex studies |

### Power Analysis for Different Tests

| Test Type | Considerations | Special Requirements |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|
| t-tests | Effect size in standard deviations | Normal distribution |
| ANOVA | Multiple groups | Equal variances |
| Chi-square | Expected frequencies | Large enough cells |
| Correlation | Expected correlation | Bivariate normal |

## Best Practices

### Planning Guidelines

1. **Before Analysis**
   * Set realistic effect sizes
   * Choose appropriate power level
   * Consider practical constraints
   * Document assumptions

2. **During Analysis**
   * Monitor power as data collected
   * Adjust if necessary
   * Document any changes
   * Consider interim analyses

3. **After Analysis**
   * Report actual power
   * Discuss limitations
   * Consider implications
   * Plan future studies

### Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Overestimating effect size | Underpowered study | Use conservative estimates |
| Ignoring practical constraints | Unrealistic plans | Consider limitations |
| Focusing only on power | Missing other issues | Consider all aspects |

## Software and Tools

### Common Software

| Software | Features | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|
| G*Power | Comprehensive | Most analyses |
| R packages | Flexible | Custom analyses |
| Online calculators | Quick estimates | Simple cases |

### Interpretation of Results

| Output | Meaning | How to Use |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Required sample size | n needed for desired power | Plan study |
| Actual power | Power for given n | Evaluate design |
| Effect size needed | Minimum detectable effect | Set expectations |
