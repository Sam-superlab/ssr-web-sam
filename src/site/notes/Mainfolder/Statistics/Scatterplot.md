## Describing a Scatterplot

To describe the relationship between variables in a scatterplot we need to mention all of the following:
- **Form**: what type of pattern exists (linear / non-linear / curved) 
- **Strength**: how close are the points? (weak / moderate / strong) 
- **Direction**: how the values of one variable relate to the values of the other variable (positive / negative)
