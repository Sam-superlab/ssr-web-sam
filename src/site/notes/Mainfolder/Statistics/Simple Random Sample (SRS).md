- **Definition:**  
  Every member of the population has an equal probability of being selected.  
  - Example: Randomly drawing names from a hat.  

- **Key Features:**  
  - No subgroups (strata) are defined.  
  - Requires a complete sampling frame (list of all population members).  
  - Minimal prior knowledge of population structure needed.  

- **Advantages:**  
  - Simple to implement.  
  - Unbiased if the population is homogeneous.  

- **Disadvantages:**  
  - May underrepresent small subgroups.  
  - Less precise if the population has significant variability.  

### Key Differences  Vs. Stratified Sampling

| Feature                | SRS                                  | Stratified Sampling                  |  
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|  
| Subgroups          | Ignores subgroups                   | Explicitly defines strata            |  
| Precision          | Lower for heterogeneous populations | Higher due to reduced variability    |  
| Implementation     | Simpler                             | More complex                         |  
| Use Case           | Homogeneous populations             | Populations with distinct subgroups  |  
### When to Use  
- SRS: Best for small, homogeneous populations or when no prior subgroup information exists.  
- Stratified: Ideal for populations with distinct subgroups needing precise representation (e.g., clinical trials, demographic surveys).
