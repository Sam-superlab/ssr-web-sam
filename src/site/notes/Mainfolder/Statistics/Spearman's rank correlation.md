## What is Spearman’s correlation
>In addition to Pearson, we have Spearman’s rank correlation (denoted $\rho$) where the values of X and Y are replaced with their rank order from smallest to largest before correlating. **Spearman’s ρ measures the monotonic association (increasing or decreasing)**

## Properties
- Spearman’s correlation is more **robust** to outliers
