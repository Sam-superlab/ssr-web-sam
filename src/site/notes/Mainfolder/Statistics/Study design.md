- [[Mainfolder/Statistics/treatment\|treatment]]
- [[Mainfolder/Statistics/explanatory variable\|explanatory variable]]

## Types of Studies
- **Experiments** are studies that involve **manipulating a [[Mainfolder/Statistics/treatment\|treatment]]** that each participant receives
	- typically treatments are *randomly assigned*(see [[Mainfolder/Statistics/Randomization\|Randomization]]) to participants
	- we then measure participants’ response to the treatment
	- the treatment is the [[Mainfolder/Statistics/explanatory variable\|explanatory variable]]
	- establish a ***[[Mainfolder/Statistics/cause-and-effect relationship\|cause-and-effect relationship]]*** 
	- We need to control everything(**[[Mainfolder/Statistics/confounding\|confounding]]**) that could change the response except for the treatments (*[[Mainfolder/Statistics/Randomization\|randomization]] of treatments is the best way to accomplish this*)
- **Observational** **Studies** are studies that **do not** involve manipulating the explanatory variables for participants.
	- we are simply ”observing” what is going on without intervening
	- nearly all surveys are observational studies


## Sample
We want our sample to be **representative** of our population
- this means that our sample is nearly the same as our population, only smaller
- a representative sample allows us to **generalize our results** from the sample to the pop.
- **biased**: a sample that is **not** representative

### Random Sample
We can choose people at random from our population to reduce the chances of getting a biased sample. Usually it is best way to get
