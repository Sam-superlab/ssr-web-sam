A **confounding variable** (or confounder) in statistics is an extraneous variable that is not accounted for in a study but influences both the explanatory (independent) variable and the response (dependent) variable. This creates a situation where the observed association between the two variables may be misleading, as the confounding variable could be the true cause of changes in the response variable.

### Key Points from the Knowledge Base:
1. Definition (Study Design Lab):
   - A confounding variable "**affects the results in an unwanted way, making it difficult to determine if the explanatory variables caused changes in the response.**"
   - Example: In the Strength Shoes® study, athleticism or genetic factors could confound results if participants self-selected their shoe type. More athletic individuals might choose Strength Shoes®, and their inherent ability—not the shoes—could explain better jumping performance.

2. Impact on Studies:
   - In observational studies, confounding variables limit conclusions to associations rather than causation (since there is no random assignment to control for confounders).
   - In experiments, random assignment helps balance confounding variables between groups, but unmeasured confounders (e.g., BMI or genetic factors in the Strength Shoes® lab) can still bias results if not addressed.

3. Example from the Lab:
   - The Strength Shoes® group had a higher mean BMI (25.58 vs. 21.42) and a higher proportion of the jumping-enhancing genetic factor (75% vs. 25%). These confounders could explain differences in jumping ability instead of the shoes themselves.

### Why It Matters:
Confounding variables threaten the validity of causal claims. To establish causation, studies must either:
- Control for confounders (e.g., balancing groups by sex/height in the lab), or  
- Use **random assignment** to distribute confounders equally across groups (as emphasized in the applet activity).
