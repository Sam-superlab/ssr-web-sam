Distribution is ...

When talking about distribution. We need to mention all of the following things: 
- **[[Mainfolder/Statistics/Shape\|Shape]]** - is the distribution symmetric, skewed, bell-shaped, bimodal? 
- **[[Mainfolder/Statistics/Center\|Center]]** - where does the data bunch up (approx. mean or median) 
- **[[Mainfolder/Statistics/Spread\|Spread]]** - how spread out is the data (ie: range of values) 
- **[[Mainfolder/Statistics/Outliers\|Outliers]]** - are there values that are much smaller/larger than the rest?
