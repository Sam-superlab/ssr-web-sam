>A **sample** is (often) a much smaller, (generally) randomly collected subgroup of a larger population

## Sampling Methods

**Simple Random Sample (SRS)**

- each *combination* of observations has same chance of being selected
	- if we were to select multiple SRSs again, different observations will be chosen
	- variability by sampling → sampling variability

**Stratified Sample**

- **strata**: subgroups of pop., within each the individuals are similar 
	- individuals within a strata are similar, but strata themselves can be very different
- we take a SRS from each strata to ensure each group has representation

## Biased Samples
>**Biased** samples are not representative of the population

**Voluntary Response Sample**
- people select themselves to participate 
- usually people with strong opinions respond to surveys


**Convenience Sample**
- people are chosen in a non-random way 
	-  poll at a specific location
-  name comes from the fact that this is ’easy’ to do
