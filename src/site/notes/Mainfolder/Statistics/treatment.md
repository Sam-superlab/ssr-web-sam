In the context of research and experiments, a treatment is something that researchers administer to experimental units. It's the key element being studied or manipulated to observe its effect. Here's a breakdown:

*   Experimental Units: These are the subjects or objects on which the experiment is conducted. They could be people, animals, plants, or even inanimate objects.

*   Application of the Treatment: The treatment is applied to the experimental units, and the researcher observes the response or outcome.

*   Control vs. Treatment Groups: Often, experiments have a control group (which doesn't receive the treatment or receives a standard/placebo treatment) and one or more treatment groups (which receive the specific treatment being investigated).

* Example:
In drug trial, The treatment is the drug given to the participants.
