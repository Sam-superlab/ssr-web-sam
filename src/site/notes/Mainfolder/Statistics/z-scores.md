## What is z-scores

$$
z_{(sample)}= \frac{x_{i}-\bar{x}}{s_{x}}, z_{(population)} = \frac{x_{i}-\mu}{\sigma}
$$

>**Z-score interpretation**: The value we get is the number of standard deviations the value is away from the mean

- **positive** z-scores are **larger** than the mean
- **negative** z-scores are **smaller** than the mean



## Properties
If we standardize a variable, what we are doing is scaling each value so that the mean becomes 0 and the standard deviation becomes 1.
- puts values on the same scale
- [[Mainfolder/Statistics/mean\|mean]] (center) = 0, [[Mainfolder/Statistics/standard deviation\|standard deviation]] (spread) = 1
- no units
